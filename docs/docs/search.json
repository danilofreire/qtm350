    "text": "Footnotes\n\n\nIn SQL, a database is a system that stores and organises multiple sets of related data. It typically contains several tables, each of which is a structured collection of data arranged in rows and columns. For instance, a ‘School’ database might contain separate tables for ‘Students’, ‘Teachers’, and ‘Classes’. Each table would store specific information: the ‘Students’ table might have columns for student ID, name, and year group, with each row representing an individual student’s details. Databases can also contain objects other than tables, such as views (virtual tables used for data retrieval), indexes (optimised data structures for faster data retrieval), and stored procedures (predefined SQL queries that can be reused). While databases are managed by Database Management Systems (DBMS), such as PostgreSQL, and handle overall data organisation and integrity, tables are manipulated using SQL commands for specific data operations within their structure, as we will see below.↩︎"

You will also learn about data storage and manipulation with SQL and Pandas, data visualisation using Matplotlib, Seaborn and plotnine, and parallel computing with Dask. We will explore artificial intelligence-assisted programming with GitHub Copilot and finish with Docker and containerisation. Throughout the course, you will learn how to use these tools to improve your data science workflow and create more reliable, reproducible, and robust analyses.\nBy working with real-world datasets and problems, students will gain hands-on experience using these tools and methods to extract insights from data. This course will develop technical skills and critical thinking needed to solve complex data challenges. Upon completion, students will be prepared to confidently apply these tools to their own research and professional work."

    "section": "Creating Markdown Tables from Pandas DataFrames in Jupyter Notebooks",
    "text": "Creating Markdown Tables from Pandas DataFrames in Jupyter Notebooks\nWhen working with pandas DataFrames, you can convert them into Markdown tables for better presentation. The method is also relatively simple. Here is how to do it:\n\nPrerequisites\nEnsure you have the following installed:\n\nJupyter Notebook\npandas\ntabulate (for enhanced table formatting)\n\nJupyter Notebook and pandas are included in the Anaconda distribution. You can install tabulate using conda install in your terminal. If you are using VS Code, you can open a terminal by clicking on “Terminal” &gt; “New Terminal” in the top menu. Then run the following command:\nconda install tabulate\n\n\nBasic Method: Using pandas.DataFrame.to_markdown()\npandas provides a built-in method to_markdown() for converting DataFrames to Markdown tables.\n\nStep 1: Import pandas and create a DataFrame\nYou can create a dataframe by passing a dictionary to the pd.DataFrame() constructor:\n\n# If necessary, install pandas and tabulate \n# You should have pandas installed if you installed Anaconda, \n# but if you do not, you can install both with the following terminal command:\n# conda install pandas tabulate\n\n# Import pandas\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom tabulate import tabulate\n\n# Create a sample DataFrame\ndata = {\n    \"Name\": [\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\"],\n    \"Age\": [25, 30, 35],\n    \"City\": [\"New York\", \"London\", \"Paris\"]\n}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n\n\nStep 2: Convert DataFrame to Markdown\nThen you just need to call the to_markdown() method on the DataFrame:\n\n# Print the DataFrame as a Markdown table, excluding the index\nmarkdown_table = df.to_markdown(index=False)\nprint(markdown_table)\n\nThis will output:\n| Name    | Age  | City     |\n|:--------|-----:|:---------|\n| Alice   |   25 | New York |\n| Bob     |   30 | London   |\n| Charlie |   35 | Paris    |\n\n\nStep 3: Display in Jupyter Notebook\nTo display the Markdown table in a Jupyter Notebook cell, use the display() function from the IPython.display module:\n\n# You should also have the IPython package installed if you installed Anaconda\n# If not, you can install it with\n# conda install ipython\n\n# Import the Markdown display class. \n# This is what allows us to display Markdown in Jupyter Notebooks \nfrom IPython.display import display, Markdown\n\n# Display the Markdown table\ndisplay(Markdown(markdown_table))\n\nThis will render a nicely formatted table in your notebook:\n\n\n\nMarkdown table in a Jupyter Notebook.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Formatting\nYou can customise the Markdown table using various parameters of to_markdown():\n\n# Customising the Markdown table using the to_markdown() method\nmarkdown_table = df.to_markdown(\n    index=False,  # Don't include index\n    tablefmt=\"pipe\",  # Use pipe format\n    floatfmt=\".2f\",  # Format floats to 2 decimal places\n    headers=[\"Name\", \"Age (Years)\", \"City\"],  # Custom headers\n    colalign=(\"left\", \"center\", \"right\")  # Align columns\n)\ndisplay(Markdown(markdown_table))\n\n\n\nUsing tabulate for Enhanced Formatting\nThe tabulate library offers even more formatting options. While they are not necessary for basic tables, they can be useful for more complex tables. In our course, you will probably not need them, but I will show you how to use them for your reference. Please check their documentation for more information.\n\nfrom tabulate import tabulate\n\nmarkdown_table = tabulate(df, headers='keys', tablefmt='pipe', showindex=False)\ndisplay(Markdown(markdown_table))\n\n\n\nBest Practices\n\nIndex: Consider whether you need the index in your table. Often, it is cleaner to exclude it using index=False.\nFormatting: Use floatfmt to control decimal places for numerical data.\nHeaders: Customize headers for clarity, especially if your DataFrame column names are not user-friendly.\nTable Format: Experiment with different tablefmt options to find the most suitable for your needs.\nLarge DataFrames: For large DataFrames, consider displaying only a subset of rows or columns to maintain readability.\n\n\n\nExample: Comprehensive Table Creation\nHere is a more comprehensive example incorporating various best practices:\n\n# Import necessary packages\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom IPython.display import display, Markdown\nfrom tabulate import tabulate\n\n# Create a sample DataFrame\ndata = {\n    \"Product\": [\"Laptop\", \"Smartphone\", \"Tablet\"],\n    \"Price\": [999.99, 599.50, 299.75],\n    \"Stock\": [50, 100, 75],\n    \"Rating\": [4.5, 4.8, 4.2]\n}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Create a formatted Markdown table\nmarkdown_table = tabulate(\n    df,\n    headers=[\"Product Name\", \"Price ($)\", \"Stock Quantity\", \"Customer Rating\"],\n    tablefmt=\"pipe\", # Format as Markdown table\n    floatfmt=(\".2f\", \".2f\", \"d\", \".1f\"),\n    showindex=False, # Don't show the index (row numbers)\n    numalign=\"right\", # Align numbers to the right\n    stralign=\"left\" # Align strings (text, first column) to the left\n)\n\n# Display the table in the notebook\ndisplay(Markdown(\"### Product Inventory Summary\"))\ndisplay(Markdown(markdown_table))\n\nThis will produce a well-formatted table with custom headers, appropriate number formatting, and a title.\n\n\n\nComprehensive Markdown table in a Jupyter Notebook."

The two packages I know that manage citations, cite2c and Jupyterlab Citation Manager, are not ideal. The first has not been maintained for years, while the second is not ready for most uses. Therefore, I suggest simply copying the citation from Google Scholar and pasting it into a Markdown cell titled “References” at the end of your document. The same approach applies for inline citations."

    "text": "Welcome to QTM 350! This course introduces key tools in modern data science, focusing on three essential aspects: reliability, reproducibility, and robustness. We will cover command line interfaces and vim, version control with Git and GitHub, and literate programming using Quarto and Jupyter Notebooks. You will also learn about data storage and manipulation with SQL and Pandas, data visualisation using Matplotlib, Seaborn and plotnine, and parallel computing with Dask. We will explore artificial intelligence-assisted programming with GitHub Copilot and finish with Docker and containerisation. Throughout the course, you will learn how to use these tools to improve your data science workflow and create more reliable, reproducible, and robust analyses.\nBy working with real-world datasets and problems, students will gain hands-on experience using these tools and methods to extract insights from data. This course will develop technical skills and critical thinking needed to solve complex data challenges. Upon completion, students will be prepared to confidently apply these tools to their own research and professional work."
