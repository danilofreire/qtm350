## Brief recap of last class
### Early computing and data representation

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- Computers evolved from [people to mechanical calculators to silicon-based machines]{.alert}
- Modern computers use the [Von Neumann architecture]{.alert}, storing both instructions and data in memory
- Computers represent data using [binary (base 2) numbers]{.alert} made up of 0s and 1s
- A [bit]{.alert} is a single binary digit; [8 bits make a byte]{.alert}
- [Hexadecimal (base 16)]{.alert} is a compact way to represent binary, with each hex digit corresponding to 4 bits
- [Abstraction]{.alert} allows representing complex data like images and text using numbers

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- Images can be broken down into a [grid of coloured pixels]{.alert}
- Colours are represented using the [RGB model]{.alert}, with each colour channel (red, green, blue) ranging from 0-255
- 8-bit color uses 256 levels per channel, allowing for over [16 million possible colors]{.alert}
- Text is broken into [individual characters]{.alert}, with each character mapped to a number using an encoding like [ASCII]{.alert}
- [ASCII is a simple lookup table]{.alert} mapping the numbers 0-255 to characters
- [Unicode]{.alert} extends ASCII to support accented characters and symbols from all languages

- The [operating system (OS)]{.alert} is system software that interfaces with (and manages access to) a computer's hardware. It also provides software resources
- The OS is divided into the [kernel and user space]{.alert}
- The [kernel]{.alert} is the core of the OS. It's responsible for interfacing with hardware (drivers), managing resources etc. Running software in the kernel is *extremely* sensitive! That's why users are kept away from it!
- The [user space]{.alert} provides an interface for users, who can run
  programs/applications on the machine. Hardware access of programmes (e.g., memory usage) is managed by the kernel. Programmes in user space are essentially in sandboxes, which sets a limit to how much damage they can do.

- The [shell]{.alert} is just a general name for any user space program that allows access to resources in the system, via some kind of interface
- Shells come in many different flavours but are generally provided to aid a human operator in accessing the system. This could be interactively, by **typing at a terminal**, or via **scripts**, which are files that contain a sequence of commands
- Modern computers use [graphical user interfaces (GUIs)]{.alert} as the standard tool for human-computer interaction
- [Why "kernel" and "shell"?]{.alert} The kernel is the soft, edible part of a nut or seed, which is surrounded by a shell to protect it. Useful metaphor, _innit_?

:::{.column width="50%"}
- Things are still a bit more complicated
- We're not directly interacting with the "shell" but using a [terminal]{.alert}
- A terminal is just a program that [reads input]{.alert} from the keyboard, [passes that input]{.alert} to another programme, and [displays the results]{.alert} on the screen
- A shell program on its own does not do this - it requires a terminal as an interface
- [Why "terminal"?]{.alert} Back in the old days (before computer screen existed), terminal machines (hardware!) were used to let humans interface with large machines ("mainframes"). Often many terminals were connected to a single machine
- When you want to work with a computer in a data center (or remotely in cloud computing), you'll still do pretty much the same

:::{.column width="50%"}
- Terminals are really quite simple - they're just interfaces.
- The first thing that a terminal program will do is run a shell program - a program that we can use to operate the computer.
- [Back to the shell:]{.alert} the shell usually takes input

  - Interactively from the user via the terminal's **command line**.
  - Executes scripts (without command line).
- In interactive mode the shell then returns output

  - To the terminal where it is printed/shown.
  - To files or other locations.

- The command line (or command prompt) represents what is shown and entered in the terminal. They can be [customised](https://ohmyz.sh/) (e.g., with color highlighting) to make interaction more convenient.

-   It is important to note that there are [many different shell programmes]{.alert}, and they [differ in terms of functionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_command_shells)
-   On most Unix-like systems, the default shell is a program called [**bash**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)), which stands for "Bourne Again Shell"
-   Other examples are the [Z Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) (or zsh; default on MacOS), [Windows Command Prompt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cmd.exe) (cmd.exe, the default CLI on MS Windows), [Windows PowerShell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerShell), [C Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_shell), and many more
-   When a terminal opens, it will immediately start the user's preferred shell programme. (This can be [changed](https://effective-shell.com/part-1-transitioning-to-the-shell/getting-started/).)

1.  [Speed.]{.alert} Typing is fast: A skilled shell user can manipulate a system at dazzling speeds just using a keyboard. Typing commands is generally much faster than exploring through user interfaces with a mouse.

2.  [Power.]{.alert} Both for executing commands and for fixing problems. There are some things you just can't do in an IDE or GUI. It also avoids memory complications associated with certain applications and/or IDEs.

3.  [Reproducibility.]{.alert} Scripting is reproducible, while clicking is not.

4.  [Portability.]{.alert} A shell can be used to interface to almost any type of computer, from a mainframe to a Raspberry Pi, in a very similar way. The shell is often the only game in town for high performance computing (interacting with servers and super computers).

5.  [Automation.]{.alert} Shells are programmable: Working in the shell allows you to program workflows, that is create scripts to automate time-consuming or repetitive processes.

6.  [Become a marketable data scientist.]{.alert} Modern programming is often polyglot. The shell provides a common interface for tooling. Modern solutions are often built to run in containers on Linux. In this environment shell knowledge has become very valuable. In short, [the shell is having a renaissance](https://effective-shell.com/part-1-transitioning-to-the-shell/the-renaissance-of-the-shell/) in the age of data science.

# The Unix philosophy {background-color="#2d4563"}

## The Unix philosophy

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 23px;"}
:::{.incremental}
The shell tools that we're going to be using have their roots in the [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) family of operating systems originally developed at Bells Labs in the 1970s.

Besides paying homage, acknowledging the Unix lineage is important because these tools still embody the "[Unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy)":

> **Do One Thing And Do It Well**

By pairing and chaining well-designed individual components, we can build powerful and much more complex larger systems.

You can see why the Unix philosophy is also referred to as "minimalist and modular".

Again, this philosophy is very clearly expressed in the design and functionality of the Unix shell.

## Shell: First look

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}

Let's open up our shell!

A convenient way to do this is through [VSCode's built-in Terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal).

Click on the **View** menu, then **Terminal**. You can also use the shortcut `Ctrl`+` ` (backtick).

Your system default shell is loaded. To find out what that is, type `echo $SHELL` in the terminal.

```{bash, echo=TRUE}
echo $SHELL
```

It's [Z shell](https://ohmyz.sh/) in my case.

Of course, it's always possible to open up the Shell directly if you prefer. It's your turn!

- [Windows](https://www.howtogeek.com/265900/everything-you-can-do-with-windows-10s-new-bash-shell/)
:::

## Shell: First look

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 27px;"}
You should see something like:

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
 username@hostname:~$
```

This is shell-speak for: "Who am I and where am I?" (Type in `$ whoami` without the leading dollar sign to confirm)

- `username` denotes a specific user (one of potentially many on this computer).

- `@hostname` denotes the name of the computer or server.

- `:~` denotes the directory path (where `~` signifies the user's home directory).

- `$` (or maybe `%`) denotes the start of the command prompt.

    - (For a special "superuser" called root, the dollar sign will change to a `#`).

```{bash, echo=TRUE}
whoami
pwd
```


:::

## Useful keyboard shortcuts

-   `Tab` completion.

-   Use the `↑` (and `↓`) keys to scroll through previous commands.

-   `Ctrl`+`→` (and `Ctrl`+`←`) to skip whole words at a time.

-   `Ctrl`+`a` moves the cursor to the beginning of the line.

-   `Ctrl`+`e` moves the cursor to the end of the line.

-   `Ctrl`+`k` deletes everything to the right of the cursor.

-   `Ctrl`+`u` deletes everything to the left of the cursor.

-   `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`c` to copy and `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`v` to paste (or just `⌘`+ `c/v` on a Mac).

-   `Ctrl`+`l` clears your terminal.

# Syntax {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Syntax

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 26px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
All Bash commands have the same basic syntax:

[**command option(s) argument(s)**]{.alert}

**Examples:**

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# list files in the Documents directory 
# with human-readable sizes

ls -lh ~/Documents 
```

<br>

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# sort the file and remove duplicates

sort -u file.txt 
```
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
**Commands**

- You don't always need options or arguments.

- For example:
    - `$ ls ~/Documents/` and `$ ls -lh` are both valid commands that will yield output.

- However, you always need a command.

# sort the file and remove duplicates

sort -u file.txt 
```
:::

:::{.column style="width: 40%; font-size: 20px;"}
**Options** (also called **Flags**)

-   Start with a dash. Usually one letter.

-   Multiple options can be chained under a single dash.

    ```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
    ls -l -a -h /var/log ## This works
    ls -lah /var/log ## So does this
    ```

-   An exception is with (rarer) options requiring two dashes.

    ```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
    ls --group-directories-first --human-readable /var/log
    ```

-   `l`: Use a long listing format. This option shows detailed information about the files and directories

-   `h`: With `-l`, print sizes in human-readable format (e.g., KB, MB)

-   `u`: Unique, it filters out the duplicate entries in the output

-   Think it's difficult to memorize what the individual letters stand for? [You're totally right!]{.alert}

Manual pages are shown in the shell *pager*. Here are the essentials to navigate through contents presented in the pager:

-   `d` - Scroll down half a page

-   `u` - Scroll up half a page

-   `j` / `k` - Scroll down or up a line. You can also use the arrow keys for this

-   `q` - Quit

-   `/pattern` - Search for text provided as "pattern"

-   `n` - When searching, find the next occurrence

-   `N` - When searching, find the previous occurrence

-   These and other `man` tricks are detailed in the help pages (hit "h" when you're in the pager for an overview).
