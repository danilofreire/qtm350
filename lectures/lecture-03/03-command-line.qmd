## Brief recap of last class
### Early computing and data representation

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- Computers evolved from [people to mechanical calculators to silicon-based machines]{.alert}
- Modern computers use the [Von Neumann architecture]{.alert}, storing both instructions and data in memory
- Computers represent data using [binary (base 2) numbers]{.alert} made up of 0s and 1s
- A [bit]{.alert} is a single binary digit; [8 bits make a byte]{.alert}
- [Hexadecimal (base 16)]{.alert} is a compact way to represent binary, with each hex digit corresponding to 4 bits
- [Abstraction]{.alert} allows representing complex data like images and text using numbers

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- Images can be broken down into a [grid of coloured pixels]{.alert}
- Colours are represented using the [RGB model]{.alert}, with each colour channel (red, green, blue) ranging from 0-255
- 8-bit color uses 256 levels per channel, allowing for over [16 million possible colors]{.alert}
- Text is broken into [individual characters]{.alert}, with each character mapped to a number using an encoding like [ASCII]{.alert}
- [ASCII is a simple lookup table]{.alert} mapping the numbers 0-255 to characters
- [Unicode]{.alert} extends ASCII to support accented characters and symbols from all languages

- The [operating system (OS)]{.alert} is system software that interfaces with (and manages access to) a computer's hardware. It also provides software resources
- The OS is divided into the [kernel and user space]{.alert}
- The [kernel]{.alert} is the core of the OS. It's responsible for interfacing with hardware (drivers), managing resources etc. Running software in the kernel is *extremely* sensitive! That's why users are kept away from it!
- The [user space]{.alert} provides an interface for users, who can run
  programs/applications on the machine. Hardware access of programmes (e.g., memory usage) is managed by the kernel. Programmes in user space are essentially in sandboxes, which sets a limit to how much damage they can do.

::: {.column width="50%"}
- The [shell]{.alert} is just a general name for any user space program that allows access to resources in the system, via some kind of interface
- Shells come in many different flavours but are generally provided to aid a human operator in accessing the system. This could be interactively, by **typing at a terminal**, or via **scripts**, which are files that contain a sequence of commands
- Modern computers use [graphical user interfaces (GUIs)]{.alert} as the standard tool for human-computer interaction
- [Why "kernel" and "shell"?]{.alert} The kernel is the soft, edible part of a nut or seed, which is surrounded by a shell to protect it. Useful metaphor, _innit_?

:::{.column width="50%"}
- Things are still a bit more complicated
- We're not directly interacting with the "shell" but using a [terminal]{.alert}
- A terminal is just a program that [reads input]{.alert} from the keyboard, [passes that input]{.alert} to another programme, and [displays the results]{.alert} on the screen
- A shell program on its own does not do this - it requires a terminal as an interface
- [Why "terminal"?]{.alert} Back in the old days (before computer screen existed), terminal machines (hardware!) were used to let humans interface with large machines ("mainframes"). Often many terminals were connected to a single machine
- When you want to work with a computer in a data center (or remotely in cloud computing), you'll still do pretty much the same

- Terminals are really quite simple - they're just interfaces
- The first thing that a terminal will do is run a shell - a programme we can use to operate the computer
- [Back to the shell:]{.alert} the shell usually takes input

  - Interactively from the user via the terminal's **command line**
  - Executes scripts (without command line)
- In interactive mode the shell then returns output

  - To the terminal where it is printed/shown
  - To files or other locations

- The command line represents what is shown and entered in the terminal. They can be [customised](https://ohmyz.sh/) (e.g., with colour highlighting) to make interaction more convenient

-   It is important to note that there are [many different shell programmes]{.alert}, and they [differ in terms of functionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_command_shells)
-   On most Unix-like systems, the default shell is a program called [**bash**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)), which stands for "Bourne Again Shell"
-   Other examples are the [Z Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) (or zsh; default on MacOS), [Windows Command Prompt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cmd.exe) (cmd.exe, the default CLI on MS Windows), [Windows PowerShell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerShell), [C Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_shell), and many more
-   When a terminal opens, it will immediately start the user's preferred shell programme. (This can be [changed](https://effective-shell.com/part-1-transitioning-to-the-shell/getting-started/).)

1.  [Speed.]{.alert} Typing is fast: A skilled shell user can manipulate a system at dazzling speeds just using a keyboard. Typing commands is generally much faster than exploring through user interfaces with a mouse.

2.  [Power.]{.alert} Both for executing commands and for fixing problems. There are some things you just can't do in an IDE or GUI. It also avoids memory complications associated with certain applications and/or IDEs.

3.  [Reproducibility.]{.alert} Scripting is reproducible, while clicking is not.

4.  [Portability.]{.alert} A shell can be used to interface to almost any type of computer, from a mainframe to a Raspberry Pi, in a very similar way. The shell is often the only game in town for high performance computing (interacting with servers and super computers).

5.  [Automation.]{.alert} Shells are programmable: Working in the shell allows you to program workflows, that is create scripts to automate time-consuming or repetitive processes.

6.  [Become a marketable data scientist.]{.alert} Modern programming is often polyglot. The shell provides a common interface for tooling. Modern solutions are often built to run in containers on Linux. In this environment shell knowledge has become very valuable. In short, [the shell is having a renaissance](https://effective-shell.com/part-1-transitioning-to-the-shell/the-renaissance-of-the-shell/) in the age of data science.

# The Unix philosophy {background-color="#2d4563"}

## The Unix philosophy

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 23px;"}
:::{.incremental}
The shell tools that we're going to be using have their roots in the [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) family of operating systems originally developed at Bells Labs in the 1970s.

Besides paying homage, acknowledging the Unix lineage is important because these tools still embody the "[Unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy)":

> **Do One Thing And Do It Well**

By pairing and chaining well-designed individual components, we can build powerful and much more complex larger systems.

You can see why the Unix philosophy is also referred to as "minimalist and modular".

Again, this philosophy is very clearly expressed in the design and functionality of the Unix shell.

# Shell basics 🐚 🤓 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Shell: First look

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}

Let's open up our shell!

A convenient way to do this is through [VS Code's built-in Terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal).

Click on the **View** menu, then **Terminal**. You can also use the shortcut ``Ctrl + ` `` (backtick).

Your system default shell is loaded. To find out what that is, type `echo $SHELL` in the terminal.

```{bash}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true

echo $SHELL
```

It is [Z shell](https://ohmyz.sh/) in my case

:::{.incremental}
... what about you? It is your turn to find out!
:::
:::

## Your turn!

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 25px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
Of course, it's always possible to open up the shell directly if you prefer. It's your turn!

- [Linux](https://www.wikihow.com/Open-a-Terminal-Window-in-Ubuntu)

- [Mac](https://www.techwalla.com/articles/how-to-open-terminal-on-a-macbook)

- [Windows](https://www.howtogeek.com/265900/everything-you-can-do-with-windows-10s-new-bash-shell/)

Feel free to check our class tutorial on [how to set up your shell in VS Code](https://danilofreire.github.io/qtm350/tutorials/01-vscode-anaconda-tutorial.html).
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
Open your terminal and type the following commands (without the `$`):

```{bash}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
echo $SHELL 
whoami 
pwd 
mkdir new-folder
cd ..
ls
man ls # type 'j' to scroll down, 'k' to scroll up, 'q' to quit
```

Share your results with a colleague (or the class)!
:::

:::

## Shell: First look

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 27px;"}
You should see something like:

```{bash}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
 username@hostname:~$
```

This is shell-speak for: "Who am I and where am I?" 

- `username` denotes a specific user (one of potentially many on this computer).

- `@hostname` denotes the name of the computer or server.

- `:~` denotes the directory path (where `~` signifies the user's home directory).

- `$` (or maybe `%`) denotes the start of the command prompt.

    - (For a special "superuser" called root, the dollar sign will change to a `#`).

```{bash}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
whoami
pwd
```

# Syntax {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Syntax

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 26px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
All bash commands have the same basic syntax:

[**command option(s) argument(s)**]{.alert}

**Examples:**

```{bash}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
# list files in the Documents directory 
# with human-readable sizes

ls -lh ~/Documents 
```

<br>

```{bash}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
# sort the file and remove duplicates

sort -u file.txt 
```
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
**Commands**

- You don't always need options or arguments

- For example:
  - `ls ~/Documents/` and `ls -lh ~/Documents` are both valid commands that will yield (different) output

- However, you always need a command.

command [option(s)]{.alert} argument(s)

**Examples:**

```{bash}
#| echo: true

# list files in the Documents directory 
# with human-readable sizes

ls -lh ~/Documents 
```

<br>

```{bash}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
# sort the file and remove duplicates

sort -u file.txt 
```
:::

:::{.column style="width: 40%; font-size: 18px;"}
**Options** (also called **Flags**)

-   Start with a dash. Usually one letter.

-   Multiple options can be chained under a single dash.

```{bash}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
ls -l -a -h /var/log # This works
ls -lah /var/log # So does this
```

-   An exception is with (rarer) options requiring two dashes.

```{bash}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
ls --group-directories-first --human-readable /var/log
```

-   `l`: Use a long listing format. This option shows detailed information about the files and directories

-   `h`: With `-l`, print sizes in human-readable format (e.g., KB, MB)

-   `u`: Unique, it filters out the duplicate entries in the output

-   Think it's difficult to memorize what the individual letters stand for? [You're totally right!]{.alert}

Manual pages are shown in the shell. Here are the essentials to navigate through contents presented in the pager:

-   `d` - Scroll down half a page
-   `u` - Scroll up half a page
-   `j` / `k` - Scroll down or up a line. You can also use the arrow keys for this
-   `q` - Quit
-   `/pattern` - Search for text provided as "pattern"
-   `n` - When searching, find the next occurrence
-   `N` - When searching, find the previous occurrence
-   These and other `man` tricks are detailed in the help pages (hit "h" when you're in the pager for an overview).

## `man` page explorer challenge

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 26px;"}
Partner up and choose a command from the list below. Use `man` to complete these tasks:

```{bash}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
# Choose one:
ls, cd, cp, mv, rm, mkdir, rmdir, touch, cat, find
```

1. Summarise the command's purpose in one sentence.
2. Find an interesting option and explain what it does.
3. Create an example using your command with at least two options.
4. Bonus: Combine your command with your partner's in a single line.

You have about 5 minutes. Be ready to share your findings!

Reflection: How was using `man` compared to online searches? How might you use it in future projects?

-   Modern operating systems increasingly abstract away from underlying file systems (think about iOS, Android)
-   For data science operations it is important that you're able to efficiently navigate your system to get information on files and folders
-   Some questions that will pop up:
  -   What is my home directory?
  -   In which directory am I currently operating?
  -   Where is my stuff?
  -   Where do I want to put my stuff?
  -   How do I navigate from here to there?

-   `cd` to change directory.

```{bash}

Let's try it out!

Accessing the `figures/` directory:

Now, let's go back to the previous directory:

```{bash}
#| echo: true
cd ../ # Go back to the previous directory

Beware of directory names that contain spaces. Say you have a directory called "My Documents". (I'm looking at you, Windows.)

- Why won't `$ cd My Documents` work?
- Bash syntax is super pedantic about spaces and ordering. Here it thinks that "My" and "Documents" are separate arguments.
- How to deal with it:
  -   Use quotation marks: `$ cd "My Documents"`.
  -   Use Tab completion to automatically "escape" the space: `$ cd My\ Documents`.
  -   Don't use spaces in file and folder names. [Just don't.]{.alert}
  -   Files and folders should be named in lowercase and use dashes or
    snake_case. These are useful conventions!
  - For instance: `assignment-05` or `assignment_05`

Follow these steps to practice using basic shell commands. Type each command
and observe the results.

1. Open your terminal and navigate to your home directory: `cd ~`
2. Create a new directory called "practice" and change into it: `mkdir practice && cd practice`
3. Create two empty files called "file1.txt" and "file2.txt": `touch file1.txt file2.txt`
4. List the contents of the directory: `ls`
5. Move file2.txt to a new name (rename), file3.txt: `mv file2.txt file3.txt`
6. List the contents again to verify the change, then return to the home
   directory: `ls && cd ~`
7. Remove the "practice" directory and its contents: `rm -r practice`
8. Verify that the directory has been removed: `ls`

## Next class

:::{style="margin-top:40px; font-size: 24px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- We will learn a bit more about the command line, especially about text processing and scripting
- We will also learn about how to use [vim](https://www.vim.org/) or [neovim](https://neovim.io/) as a text editors
  - Vim is a powerful text editor that is highly configurable and can be used
    for many different programming languages. _And it is my editor of choice!_ 🤓
- After that, we will introduce [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com) for version control and collaboration
