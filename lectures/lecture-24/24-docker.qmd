# Hello, everyone! 😊 {background-color="#2d4563"}

# Brief recap of last class 📚 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Reproducible workflows, virtual environments, and containers

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 22px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- [Reproducibility]{.alert} is the ability to recreate the results of a computational analysis
- There is currently a [reproducibility crisis](https://www.nature.com/articles/533452a) in science
- [Dependency management]{.alert} is the process of specifying and installing the software dependencies of a project
- [Virtual environments]{.alert} are isolated Python environments that allow you to install packages without affecting the system Python installation
  - `conda`, `pipenv`, `virtualenv`
- [Containers]{.alert} are lightweight, standalone, executable packages of software that include everything needed to run an application
  - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is the most widely used container platform

## Docker for Data Science

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- Last time, we saw how to create a simple container with Docker
- The example included a short [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) to build the container, which included a [Python image](https://hub.docker.com/_/python), and a few Python packages in it
- We then saw how to run the container and execute a Python script, and how to [upload the container to Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/danilofreire/datasci350-example)
- Today, we will see other Docker features that are useful for data science and build more complex containers
- We will also discuss how to use Docker in a production environment, and how to deploy containers to the cloud
- If time allows, we will also have some time for Q&A about your projects (we will also have some time in our next class)

## A container for all tools we covered in this course

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 30px;"}
- Today we will have a hands-on session where we will build a container with [all the tools we have covered in this course (!)]{.alert} 🤓
- That includes a `bash` shell, a `git` client, a `Python` interpreter, a `Jupyter` notebook server, a `Quarto` document processor, a `SQL` database, and `Jupyter` tools
- We will build the container using a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/), and then run it locally
- The container will be based on the [official Ubuntu image](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu) (the same we used when creating an AWS instance), and we will install all the necessary packages in it
- We will explore how to [mount volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) in the container to persist data
- We will also discuss how to manage dependencies effectively within the container
:::

## A container for all tools we covered in this course

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 30px;"}
- As we saw in the last lecture, there are many Docker images for data science, such as [Jupyter](https://hub.docker.com/r/jupyter/datascience-notebook), [RStudio](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/rstudio), and [SQLite](https://hub.docker.com/r/alpine/sqlite)
- There are many ways to build (multiple) containers. For example:
  - [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), which allows you to define multi-container applications in a single file
  - [VS Code's Dev Containers extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers), which integrates Docker with Visual Studio Code
  - [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), which is used for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerised applications
- But to keep things simple, we will use a single container today and run it with the `docker run` command
:::

# Let's get started! 🚀 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Docker Desktop and Ubuntu

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- First, make sure you have [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed on your computer. It has everything you need to build, run, and share containers
- If you are using Windows, you may need to enable [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) to run Linux containers. You should have done that already!
- We will use [Ubuntu 24.04 (Long Term Support, LTS)](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu) as the base image for our container
- As you know by now, [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) is the most popular Linux distribution and is widely used in data science and machine learning
- But you won't even feel you are interacting with Ubuntu, as you will be using it inside a container

## Downloading Docker Desktop

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 32px;"}
- Please download Docker Desktop for your operating system here: <https://www.docker.com/>
- There are versions for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- You can install it like any other application, just follow the instructions of the installer
- Docker now has a native Windows application, so it should work without any issues
- More information here: <https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/>

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- If you don't have a Docker Hub account yet, please create one here: <https://hub.docker.com/signup>
- Docker has several types of accounts, but the free account is enough for academic purposes
- You can use Docker Hub to store your images and share them with others
- If you click on `Sign in` on the Docker Desktop application or on the website, it will open a web browser and ask you to log in
- Please enter your credentials and log in

## Anatomy of a Dockerfile revisited
### `FROM image:tag`

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 22px;"}
- As we saw in the last lecture, a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image
- The Dockerfile is a recipe for building a container
- The base image is the starting point for the container, and it can be any image available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)
- So please create a text file called `Dockerfile` (without any extension) in your directory
- Any editor will do to create the file! 😉
- You will need about 2 GB of free space to build the container, so make sure you have enough space on your computer
- We will start our Dockerfile with `FROM`, followed by the base image we want to use

```Dockerfile
# Use the official Ubuntu image as the base image
FROM ubuntu:24.04
```

- The `:` character is used to specify the version of the image. In this case, we are using Ubuntu 24.04
- You can see all tags available for the Ubuntu image at <https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu?tab=tags>
- Okay, that's the easy part. Now let's install all the tools we need in the container! 🛠️
:::

## `LABEL` command

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
- The `LABEL` instruction adds metadata to an image
- This is useful for documentation purposes and to provide information about the image
- You can add any key-value pairs you want, but it is a good practice to include the version, description, maintainer, and license
- You can also add a `MAINTAINER` instruction to specify the maintainer of the image
- For instance, you can add the following lines to your Dockerfile

```Dockerfile
# Metadata
LABEL version="1.0"
LABEL description="Container with the tools covered in DATASCI 350"
LABEL maintainer="Danilo Freire <danilo.freire@emory.edu>"
LABEL license="MIT"
```
- This will add the metadata to the image, and you can see it when you run the `docker inspect` command
:::
      
## `RUN` command

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
- The `RUN` instruction executes any commands in a new layer on top of the current image and commits the results
- Yes, [commits in Docker are like commits in Git](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/commit/), but instead of saving changes to a file system, they save changes to an image
- Remember `apt`? We will use it again to install software packages (as we did with AWS) 
- The only commands we will need to use are `apt-get update` (only once) and `apt-get install <package>`
  - For example, to install `git`, we would run `apt-get update && apt-get install git -y` 
- I will also use the `--no-install-recommends` flag to avoid installing unnecessary packages
- The `-y` flag is used to automatically answer `yes` to any prompts
- To keep the image smaller, we will also run `apt-get clean` and `rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*` after installing the packages
  - This will remove the package cache and clean up the image
- Let's add some packages to the Dockerfile 🐳
:::

## `RUN` command

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
```Dockerfile
# Update and install dependencies
# Versions: https://packages.ubuntu.com/
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends\
    bash=5.2.21-2ubuntu4 \
    git=1:2.43.0-1ubuntu7.3 \
    sqlite3=3.45.1-1ubuntu2 \
    libsqlite3-0=3.45.1-1ubuntu2 \
    python3.12=3.12.3-1ubuntu0.8 \
    python3.12-venv=3.12.3-1ubuntu0.8 \
    python3-pip=24.0+dfsg-1ubuntu1.3 && \ 
    apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

- So far, so good! 😃 
- You can see that we are installing [specific versions of the packages]{.alert}, which is a good practice to ensure reproducibility
- On Ubuntu, you can find the available versions of a package at <https://packages.ubuntu.com/>
- Make sure to match the version of the operating system with the version of the package (`24.04 LTS` or `noble` in this case)
:::

## Setting the default shell to `bash`

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 30px;"}
- By default, Docker uses `sh` as the default shell, but we want to use `bash` instead
- We can set the default shell to `bash` by adding the following line to the Dockerfile

```Dockerfile
# Set the default shell to bash
SHELL ["/bin/bash", "-c"]
```

- The `SHELL` instruction sets bash as the default shell for subsequent `RUN` commands
- The `-c` flag is required because it tells bash to read commands from a string (text), not from a file or standard input
- This way, we can use `bash` commands in the Dockerfile without having to specify the shell every time
:::

## Hey Danilo, wait a minute...🤔
### Isn't that a lot of work?

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 30px;"}
- [Yes, it is!]{.alert} 😅
- I am purposely making it harder than it should be!
- But this is the most flexible way to build a container 
- We are starting from a really bare-bones image (Ubuntu) and installing everything from scratch
- And I (we?) don't have Ubuntu installed on my computer, so I can't just run `apt list --installed` to see which packages are installed on my system and just copy them to the Dockerfile
- In this case, it did involve some research to find the right package names and versions
- But once you have the Dockerfile, you can reuse it as many times as you want
:::

## Reusing the Dockerfile

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 25px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- You could also have saved some time by using a [Python image](https://hub.docker.com/_/python) as the base image
- The Python image already comes with Python and `pip` installed, so you would only need to install the other packages
- Thus, my suggestion here is, if you are building a container for a specific purpose, [start with an image that is closer to what you need]{.alert}
- For instance, you can download a [Jupyter image with a full data science stack with one line of code](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/selecting.html)
- But it wouldn't be so fun, would it? 😅

## Back to the Dockerfile
### Installing Python packages with `pip`

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 22px;"}
- We will use the `RUN` instructions to install a few Python libraries with `pip3`, such as `numpy`, `pandas`, `jupyterlab`, `dask`, and `matplotlib`
- You can either see the versions you already have on your computer with `pip freeze > requirements.txt` and then copy the versions from the file
- Ubuntu requires us to create a virtual environment to install Python packages, so we will do that too
- I will use the `-m` flag to run the `venv` module as a script and create a virtual environment in the `/opt/venv` directory
- `ENV PATH="/opt/venv/bin:$PATH"` prepends the directory `/opt/venv/bin` to the beginning of the existing `PATH` environment variable within the Docker image
- This allows us to use the Python interpreter and packages installed in the virtual environment without needing to specify the full path every time

```Dockerfile
# Create and activate virtual environment
RUN python3 -m venv /opt/venv
ENV PATH="/opt/venv/bin:$PATH"

# Install Python dependencies in virtual environment
RUN pip install httpx==0.27.2 numpy==1.26.4 pandas==2.2.2 \
                jupyterlab==4.2.5 ipykernel==6.29.5 \
                dask==2024.5.0 matplotlib==3.9.2
```
:::

## Installing Quarto with `wget`

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 22px;"}
- We will also install [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), but this time we will use `wget` to download the binary
- Why? Because Quarto is not available on `pip` or `apt`, so we need to download it from the official website: <https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/>
- [`wget`](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/) is a command-line utility that allows you to download files from the web
- It runs on Unix-like systems, so it is available on Ubuntu, macOS, and even on Windows
- Once we download the `.deb` file (which is the package format for Ubuntu), we can install it with `apt-get install <package>` (like we did with the other packages)
- We can download any file from the web with `wget`, as long as we have the URL
- I use the `./` prefix to ensure that `apt-get` installs the local file, not a package from the repositories
- `rm` just removes the downloaded file after installation to keep the image size smaller

```Dockerfile
# Download and install Quarto
# Install Quarto
RUN wget https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/releases/download/v1.6.43/quarto-1.6.43-linux-amd64.deb && \
    apt-get install -y ./quarto-1.6.43-linux-amd64.deb && \
    rm ./quarto-1.6.43-linux-amd64.deb
```
:::

## We are almost there! 🏁
### Running the Jupyter notebook server

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 21px;"}
- Finally, we will run the Jupyter notebook server in the container
- We will have access to the Jupyter notebook server on port `8888`, so we will need to expose this port with the `EXPOSE` instruction
- What is cool is that the new JupyterLab version comes with an embedded terminal, so we can run `bash` inside the JupyterLab interface and have access to all the tools we installed in the container (like `git`, `sqlite3`, and `Quarto`) 😉
- Let's also create a working directory for the Jupyter notebook server, so we can persist the notebooks outside the container

```Dockerfile
# Base image

    # Install the local deb file (notice the "./" prefix)
    apt-get install -y ./quarto-1.6.37-linux-arm64.deb && \
    rm quarto-1.6.37-linux-arm64.deb && \
    apt-get clean && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Create a directory for saving files

```
:::

## Building the container

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 22px;"}
- Now that we have the Dockerfile, we can build the container with the `docker build` command

```{verbatim}
docker build -t datasci350-container .
```

- The `-t` flag is used to tag the image with a name, in this case `datasci350-container`
- The `.` at the end of the command specifies the build context, which is the current directory
- Now we just need to wait for the image to be built and then run it with the `docker run` command
- Let's see how it goes! 🤞

:::{style="text-align: center;"}
![](figures/docker01.png)
:::
:::

## Oh, no! 😱

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 22px;"}
- We got an error when building the container! 😕

```verbatim
[...]

4.585 Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
4.585 requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
4.585 distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
4.585 or been moved out of Incoming.
4.585 The following information may help to resolve the situation:
4.585 
4.585 The following packages have unmet dependencies:
4.650  sqlite3 : Depends: libsqlite3-0 (= 3.45.1-1ubuntu2) but 3.45.1-1ubuntu2.1 is to be installed
4.651 E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.
```
- The error message indicates that there are unmet dependencies for the `sqlite3` package!
:::

## Fixing the error 🔧

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 22px;"}
- But that's fine, we know how to fix it! 😎
- We can resolve the unmet dependencies by [ensuring the correct versions of the packages are installed]{.alert} 
- So we go to <https://packages.ubuntu.com/>, search for `libsqlite3-0` and check the available versions
- We can see that the version `3.45.1-1ubuntu2` is available, so we can just add it to the `apt-get install` command
- Let's update the Dockerfile and try again

```Dockerfile
    libsqlite3-0=3.45.1-1ubuntu2 \
```
- Now we can build the container again with the same command as before

```{verbatim}
docker build -t datasci350-container .
```

- This time it should work! 🤞
:::

## Success! 🎉

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 22px; text-align: center;"}
![](figures/docker02.png)
:::

## Running the container

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 22px;"}
- To run the container, we will use the `docker run` command
- We will also use the `-p` flag to map the port `8888` of the container to the port `8888` of the host machine
- We will also use the `-v` flag to mount a volume in the container, so we can persist the notebooks outside the container

```{verbatim}
docker run -p 8888:8888 -v $(pwd):/workspace datasci350-container
```

- The `-v` flag is used to mount the current directory (`$(pwd)`) to the `/workspace` directory in the container
- This way, we can save the notebooks outside the container and access them even after the container is stopped
- Now we just need to open a web browser and go to <http://127.0.0.1:8888> to access the JupyterLab interface 🚀
- Jupyter will also generate a token for you to access the interface, so you will need to copy and paste the token from the terminal to the web browser (or click on the link)

:::

## How to manage the container

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 22px;"}
- To stop the container, you can press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where the container is running
- You can also run the `docker ps` command to see the list of running containers and then run the `docker stop` command with the container ID
- You can also remove the container with the `docker rm` command and the image with the `docker rmi` command
- Or you can just check Docker Desktop and stop the container from there, as well as remove or restart it
- To tag and push the container to Docker Hub, you can use the `docker tag` and `docker push` commands
  
```{verbatim}
docker tag datasci350-container danilofreire/datasci350-container
docker push danilofreire/datasci350-container
```
:::

## Cleaning up

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 22px;"}
- To clean up your system, you can remove the container and the image with the following commands
- First, list the running containers with `docker ps -a` to get the container ID or name. `ps` is short for "process status" and the `-a` flag shows all containers, including those that are stopped
- Then, stop the container if it is running with `docker stop <container_id_or_name>`
- Next, remove the container with `docker rm <container_id_or_name>`
- Finally, remove the image with `docker rmi datasci350-container`
- You can also use `docker system prune` to remove all stopped containers, unused networks, images, and build cache (use the `-a` flag to remove all unused images too). [Warning]{.alert}: This is a more aggressive cleanup command!

```{verbatim}
docker ps -a
docker stop <container_id_or_name>
docker rm <container_id_or_name>
docker rmi datasci350-container
# Optional: docker system prune -a
```

## Running Docker containers on AWS

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 30px;"}
- There are many ways to run Docker containers on AWS:
- You can use the [Amazon Elastic Container Service](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/), which is a fully managed container orchestration service. More information here: <https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/getting-started/>
- [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/), which allows you to develop your machine learning models. More information here: <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/docker-containers.html>
- [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/). More information here: <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/images-create.html>
- And of course, you use an EC2 instance and install Docker on it, like we did a few weeks ago!
:::

## Running Docker containers on AWS
### An easy way to run our container on an EC2 instance

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 22px;"}

# On your local machine: upload the Docker image to Docker Hub
docker tag datasci350-container danilofreire/datasci350-container
docker push danilofreire/datasci350-container

# On your EC2 instance: install Docker, start the Docker service, and add your user to the docker group
sudo apt update && \
    sudo apt install -y docker.io -y && \
    sudo systemctl start docker && \
    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# Pull the Docker image from Docker Hub
docker pull danilofreire/datasci350-container

# Run the Docker container
docker run -p 8888:8888 -v $(pwd):/workspace danilofreire/datasci350-container

# Access JupyterLab via web browser

## Summary of the Dockerfile

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 22px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- We have seen how to build a container with all the tools we covered in this course
- We started with the `FROM` instruction to specify the base image, then used the `RUN` instruction to install the system packages and the Python libraries
- We also used the `ENV` instruction to set the `PATH` environment variable, the `EXPOSE` instruction to expose the port for the Jupyter notebook server, and the `CMD` instruction to start the Jupyter notebook server
- We also added some metadata to the container with the `LABEL` instructions
- We then built the container with the `docker build` command and ran it with the `docker run` command
- We also saw how to manage the container, stop it, remove it, and push it to Docker Hub
