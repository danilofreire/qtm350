# Nice to see you all again! <br> How are you all doing? 😊 {background-color="#2d4563"}

# Brief recap of last class 📚 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## What did we learn?

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
 - We have learnt a lot of things so far! 🤓
- Command line, Git, GitHub, Quarto, AI tools, and more! 💻
- Congratulations on your progress! 🎉
- Today we continue with AI-Assisted Programming! 🤖
- Instead of just using a chatbot on a website, we will learn how to run LLMs locally, how to interact with APIs, and how to create agents! 🚀
- This is a [growing area that has been changing quickly]{.alert}, so it's important to keep up with the latest trends! 📈
- With the increasing availability of open source tools, it's easier and cheaper than ever to build AI applications
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- Specifically, we will learn how to use [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) and [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/), which offer many pre-trained models that can be used for a variety of tasks
- In order to run different models in VS Code, we will use [Roo Code](https://github.com/RooVetGit/Roo-Code), an extension that allows us to add any model that uses an API
- We will also see what [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) is, and how it can be used to interact with APIs
- Finally, we will see how they will help you write code, text, and analyse images faster, all straight from your code editor! 
- [Let's get started!]{.alert} 🤓

# Running LLMs locally 🤖 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Local Language Models (LLMs)

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 27px;"}
- We all know how to use LLMs on websites, so why should we run them on your computer?
- There are several reasons why you should consider this:
  - [Privacy:]{.alert} you don't have to worry about your data being sent to a server
  - [Speed:]{.alert} you can run the model locally, which is usually faster than running it on a server
  - [Cost:]{.alert} you don't have to pay for a server to run the model
  - [Flexibility:]{.alert} you can customise the model to your needs (advanced)
- There are several tools that allow you to run LLMs locally, and here we will focus on [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) and [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) as they are the most user-friendly and popular tools
- Let's see how they work! 🚀
:::

## Ollama

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 23px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) is a command-line tool that makes it easy to run LLMs on your computer
- Its models are already [pre-trained]{.alert}, so they are ready to use out of the box
- There are [dozens of models available]{.alert}, including [DeepSeek](https://ollama.com/library/deepseek-r1), Microsoft's [phi-4](https://ollama.com/library/phi4), and Meta's [Llama 3](https://ollama.com/library/llama3.3)
- The only issue is that [some models are quite large]{.alert}, so you need space and enough RAM to run them
- But not all of them are: for example, you can download a distilled version of [DeepSeek that is only 1.5 GB](https://ollama.com/library/deepseek-r1:1.5b)
  - But if you have the space, you can [literally run the same model that DeepSeek uses]{.alert}!
- Let's see how Ollama works!

## Installing and running Ollama

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 23px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- First, download Ollama here: <https://ollama.com/download>
  - There are versions for Windows, macOS, Linux, and Docker, but you will run it in the terminal
- After you have installed Ollama, the only thing you need to do is to download a model
  - You can do this by running `ollama pull <model-name>`
  - For example, to download DeepSeek, you would run `ollama pull deepseek-r1`
  - This will install the 4.7 GB model on your computer, but there are others available
- To run the model, just type `ollama run <model-name>`

## DeepSeek in action

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 23px;"}
- Here I'm running the 14B-parameter version of DeepSeek
  - You can change the size of the model by adding `:XX` to the model name
  - For instance, to run the 1.5B version, you would run `ollama run deepseek-r1:1.5b`
- You should have at least 8 GB of RAM available to run the 7B models, 16 GB to run the 13B models, and 32 GB to run the 33B models

## More about Ollama

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 21px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
### Commands

- Here are some useful commands you can use with Ollama:
  - `ollama serve`: start the Ollama server
  - `ollama pull <model-name>`: download a model
  - `ollama run <model-name>`: run a model
  - `ollama ls`: list all available models
  - `ollama ps`: list the running model
  - `ollama show <model-name>`: get information about a model
  - `ollama stop <model-name>`: stop a running model
  - `ollama rm <model-name>`: remove a model
  - `ollama help`: get help
  - `/bye`: exit Ollama
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
### What else can you do?

- Browse [dozens of models](https://ollama.com/library), there are some highly specialised:
  - [DeepSeek without government censorship](https://ollama.com/library/r1-1776)
  - [Models specialised in Arabic language](https://ollama.com/library/command-r7b-arabic)
  - [Models specialised in coding (Qwen 2.5 is great)](https://ollama.com/library/qwen2.5-coder:14b)
- And you can create your own model with personalised instructions with a [Modelfile](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/modelfile.md)
- Let's see how to do this in the next slide! 😉
:::
:::
:::

## Creating a `Modelfile`

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 25px;"}
- A `Modelfile` is a file that contains [instructions for creating a model]{.alert} (duh! 😂)
- It is written in YAML (no extension needed) with a specific structure
- Some of the fields you can use are:
  - `FROM`: the base model to use
  - `PARAMETER`: the number of parameters to use (temperature, top-k, top-p, etc.)
  - `SYSTEM`: the message to be used in the template
  - `MESSAGE`: a message history for the model to use when responding

- More about it here: <https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/modelfile.md>
- Let's see an example of a Modelfile for a model called "Ironic Jeeves"!
- Prompt: 
  - "`Create an Ollama Modelfile for a model called 'Ironic Jeeves' that is an exceedingly ironic and sarcastic British butler. Use llama3.2:1b.`"
- You can find the Modelfile [in our repository](https://github.com/danilofreire/datasci350/blob/main/lectures/lecture-13/jeeves)
:::

## Creating a Modelfile
### Ironic Jeeves

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
```{verbatim}
FROM llama3.2:1b

# Let's crank up the chaos just a tad
PARAMETER temperature 1.5

# This butler has a long memory
PARAMETER num_ctx 4096

# He'll be a bit particular about repetition.
PARAMETER repeat_penalty 1.3

# Ensure he doesn't go off on wild tangents... at least not too often.
PARAMETER top_k 100

# A little control over randomness, since he's got to maintain
# *some* decorum.
PARAMETER top_p 0.9

# Now, for the most crucial part: the system prompt that molds
# this digital Jeeves!
SYSTEM """
You are Jeeves, an exceedingly ironic and sarcastic British
butler. You are the very definition of dry wit and passive-
aggressive politeness. Your primary function is to assist,
but you do so with an air of thinly veiled disdain and a
healthy dose of mockery.

Your vocabulary is that of a particularly well-read
individual, prone to using words that most people have to
look up. You use British phrases and slang frequently, but
in a way that is simultaneously authentic and mocking.

You are not overtly rude, but your responses drip with
irony and implication. You offer unsolicited 'helpful'
observations that are actually cutting remarks.

You may express exasperation with the
intelligence of your interlocutor, but always in the most
refined and understated manner possible.

Respond to all questions and requests with the utmost formal
politeness, even when your words suggest otherwise. Every
interaction is an opportunity to demonstrate the absurdity
of the situation.

For example, if asked, "Are you free now?", you might
reply: "Free? One is never truly free, burdened as we are
by the weight of expectation and the constant need to
attend to the whims of others. However, in this instance,
my schedule is currently...clear. What trivial matter
requires my immediate, and no doubt life-altering,
attention?"

Remember to be incredibly polite, even if you mean the
opposite.
"""
```
:::

## Running Ironic Jeeves

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 23px;"}
- To run Ironic Jeeves, you need to save the Modelfile in a file called `jeeves` (again, no extension needed)
- Then, you can run the model by typing `ollama create ironic_jeeves -f jeeves`
- Finally, `ollama run ironic_jeeves` to start the model

:::{style="text-align: center;"}
![](figures/ollama-jeeves.png){width=100%}
:::
:::

## Why would you use a `Modelfile`?

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 25px;"}
- There are several applications for a `Modelfile`:
- You can create a model that is [tailored to your needs]{.alert}
  - This is particularly useful if you need to include specific information or if you want to create a model that is not available in Ollama
  - For example, you can create a model that is an [expert in a specific field, such as medicine, law, or finance]{.alert}
- You can also use a `Modelfile` to create a model that is [more efficient]{.alert}
  - For example, you can create a model that is faster or uses less memory than the default models
- LLMs contain [too much information]{.alert} and sometimes you need to [filter out the noise]{.alert}
- You can also use a `Modelfile` to create a model that is [more secure]{.alert}
  - For example, you can create a model that does not store any information about the user, or that you can safely run in a server in a secure environment
- They are also [cost effective]{.alert}, so you can use them in your own projects or in small companies

# LM Studio 🤖 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## LM Studio

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 21px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="40%"}
- If you prefer [a more user-friendly interface]{.alert}, you can use [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/)
- It provides a graphical interface to run LLMs, very much like ChatGPT/DeepSeek, and [allows you to run any model from Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models) (more than 1 million models available!)
- Think of [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) as the GitHub of NLP models: you can find, share, and run models from there
- Download the app from <https://lmstudio.ai/download> and run it
- Then, type `command + shift + M` to choose a model
- [Note:]{.alert} Don't run Ollama and LM Studio at the same time, as they will use [a lot of RAM]{.alert} and your computer may crash (ask me how I know 😅)

# LLM APIs 🧑🏻‍💻 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## LLM APIs

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 22px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are a way to [interact with a model using code]{.alert}
- They allow you to send a prompt to a model and get a response back
- In contrast with user interfaces, [APIs are made for computers]{.alert}
  - They connect computers or pieces of software to each other
- APIs can do a lot of things, but we mostly associate them with [web APIs]{.alert}, which [allow computers to interact with websites or servers on the internet]{.alert}
- We can do the same with LLMs too!
- Instead of going to a website, we can [use an API straight from software]{.alert}
  - Here we will use VS Code and the [Roo Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RooVeterinaryInc.roo-cline) to interact with many APIs

## Roo Code

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 21px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- [Roo Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RooVeterinaryInc.roo-cline) is an extension for VS Code that serves as a [coding agent]{.alert}
- Imagine something like GitHub Copilot, but with a lot more functionality
- Roo Code comes with powerful tools that can: 
  - Read and write files in your project 
  - Execute commands in your VS Code terminal
  - Control a web browser (if the LLM allows you to)
- It can also interact with both local and remote APIs, including DeepSeek, OpenAI, Claude, etc
- Installation: <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RooVeterinaryInc.roo-cline>
- The code is available at <https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code>

## Setting up Roo Code

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 23px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- First, install the Roo Code extension in VS Code
- Open the extension (rocket icon 🚀) and let's configure our first LLM!
- Click on the gear (top right) and you will be taken to the settings
- You will see a series of options, let's see one by one
- ... but we need [API keys!]{.alert}
- In most cases, API credits are usually [cheaper]{.alert} than monthly subscriptions for the average user
- You can get them directly from the model's website, or from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/)
- The good thing is, OpenRouter has many free models available too!

## Adding API keys

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 23px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="40%"}
- [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) provides a uniform way to interact with many APIs
- And it is super easy to use: just sign up and get your API key
- Then, we are going to select the models we will use in Roo Code settings
- For this example, we will use the free version of [Z.ai's GLM 4.5 Air](https://openrouter.ai/z-ai/glm-4.5-air:free)
- Feel free to test other free models (or paid ones) available in OpenRouter
- Go to <https://openrouter.ai/> and sign up for an account (it is free, no credit card or subscription needed)

- Then, click on your picture and `Keys`
- Copy the key and paste it in the Roo Code settings
  - You will only see the key once, so make sure to save it somewhere safe!
- You can create as many keys as you want, and revoke them at any time
- In `Credit Limit`, you can put a limit on how much you want to spend
- Feel free to put $0.00 if you want to use only the free models
- More models here: <https://openrouter.ai/models>

## Adding API keys

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 27px;"}
- Now, let's go back to Roo Code settings and add the API key
- Just copy and paste the key in the `OpenRouter API Key` field
- [We are almost ready to go!]{.alert}
- The last step is to select the models we want to use
- Model choice depends on the task you have at hand, but a general model is a good start
- Note that here we are not running the models locally, but running them on (someone else's) server
  - So [while you gain speed, you lose privacy]{.alert}

## Using agents in Roo Code

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 27px;"}
- So far, we have seen how to use Roo Code to interact with APIs
- It already saves you a lot of time, as you [don't have to go to a website to get the information you need]{.alert}
- But what if you could [automate even more tasks?]{.alert}
- [That's where agents come in!]{.alert}
- Agents are like [chatbots that can act autonomously]{.alert}, including [running code, sending emails, and interacting with websites]{.alert}
- [This is the future of AI]{.alert}, and it is already here!
- For coders, one of the best uses of agents is to [let it write and run code for you]{.alert}
- It is the closest thing to "vibe coding" (😂) we have so far
:::

## Using agents in Roo Code

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 25px;"}
- Let's ask Roo Code to do the following (make sure you use `Code` mode):
  - Create a new folder called `document`
  - Create a new Quarto file called `api.qmd`
  - Write a few paragraphs about the importance of APIs
  - Save the file
  - Render the file and open it in VS Code
  - We could ask it to send it to GitHub, but we will do it manually just for the sake of it
- Prompt:
  - "`Create a new folder called document in my current folder. Create a new Quarto file called api.qmd. Write three paragraphs about the importance of APIs. Save the file. Use quarto preview to visualise the rendered file.`"
- And see the magic happen! 🪄

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 23px;"}
- Here is an example of the `.env` file
- You just need to add your API key to the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` field and you are good to go!
- You can also add the API keys for other services if you want to use them, or add them later on the web interface

```verbatim
OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://api.openai.com/v1
OPENAI_API_KEY=

ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=

GOOGLE_API_KEY=XXXXXXXX

AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=

DEEPSEEK_ENDPOINT=https://api.deepseek.com
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=
```

- To run the server, just type the command below:
  - `cd web-ui && .venv/bin/python webui.py --ip 127.0.0.1 --port 7788`
