# Hello again! 😊 <br> How's everything? {background-color="#2d4563"}

# Brief recap of last class 📚 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Parallel computing with Dask

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 26px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- First, we learnt about [Dask Clusters](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/setup/clusters.html), which allow you to scale your computations across multiple cores or machines
- We saw how to parallelise the training of machine learning models
- How to use automated machine learning (AutoML) tools to speed up the process
- We also discussed how to implement different methods to search for the best hyperparameters using TPOT, scikit-learn, and Dask

## Lecture outline

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 21px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="45%"}
- Today we will talk about a different topic: [how to make sure your results are reproducible?]{.alert}
- We will discuss the importance of [dependency management, virtual environments, and containers]{.alert}
- [Replication has been a recurring theme]{.alert} in this course, and today we will learn how to make it easier
- That is the main reason why we use the command line, git, Quarto, Jupyter, and other tools
- So today we will discuss some of the [best practices to ensure computational reproducibility]{.alert}
- We will also discuss how to use [containers]{.alert} to make your code portable, reproducible, and scalable
- Let's get started! 🚀

# Dependency management 📦 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Congratulations! 🎉

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 26px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- [You now have a project!]{.alert}
- Your code works great, it runs pretty fast thanks to Dask, your Quarto reports are beautiful, and your analyses (all done in the command line) are stored in a well-documented GitHub repository
- Are you done? 🤔
- [Not quite!]{.alert} 😅
- What if you need to run your code on a different machine? Or share it with a colleague? Or run it again in a few months?
- You need to [make sure your code will run in the future]{.alert}, and that's where dependency management comes in

## Why do we need dependency management? 🤔

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 21px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
### The problem

- As we have seen in this course (and in many others), [libraries and packages change constantly]{.alert}
- New versions are released, old versions are deprecated, and not all operating systems have the required libraries installed to run your code
- Even extremely simple code can break from one version of a library to the next
- This code written in Python 2.7:

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
print "Hello, world!"
```

- will not work in Python 3.x

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
print "Hello world!"
```

```{verbatim}
  File "/var/folders/96/r1yycxlj28958p1cdynhbyzw0000gn/T/Rtmpa0OGSM/chunk-code-b08d2b78904b.txt", line 1
    print "Hello world!"
                       ^
SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'. Did you mean print("Hello world!")?
```

### Some definitions

- [Dependency management]{.alert} is the process of ensuring that your code will run in the future
- [Dependencies]{.alert} are the external components necessary to run your code, such as libraries, packages, and software
- [Packages]{.alert} have a name, a type, a version, relevant files for the package's functionality, and potentially dependencies on other packages
- A [package registry]{.alert} is a directory for packages and stores metadata about packages in the registry, such as [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/), [PyPI](https://pypi.org/), or [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)
- [Dependency management tools]{.alert} help you manage your dependencies, such as [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) and [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)

## The reproducibility crisis 🚨

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 21px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- We have already seen how important it is to ensure that your results are reproducible
- The [reproducibility crisis]{.alert} is a term used to describe the inability of researchers to replicate the results of a study
- This affects computer science, statistics, and many other fields
- Apart from statistical issues such as p-hacking, publication bias, and low statistical power, one of the main reasons for the reproducibility crisis is the [lack of proper documentation and dependency management]{.alert}
- While the statistical problems are a bit more complex, the latter [can be easily solved with tools that we already have at our disposal]{.alert}
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- According to a recent [Nature survey](https://www.nature.com/articles/533452a), more than 70% of scholars have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist's research, and [more than half have failed to reproduce their own research]{.alert} 😳
- 90% of researchers believe that there is a reproducibility crisis in science

:::

- How far should we go to ensure that our results are reproducible?
- [Due diligence starts at declaring dependencies]{.alert}
- You can [manage your declared dependencies]{.alert} with a package/environment manager such as `conda` or `pip`
- You can also [package your dependencies]{.alert} with tools like `renv` (for R), or `pipenv` (for Python)
- Online environments can be created for your work (in a relatively user-friendly way), such as [Code Ocean](https://codeocean.com/) ($$$), or [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) (free, but with several limitations)
- [Containers are awesome]{.alert}, and container tools like [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/singularity/) can be used to package your code and dependencies in a portable way
- Which one should you use? It depends on your needs, but the more integrated your workflow is, the better!
:::

## How to declare dependencies? 📜

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 19px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- Imagine that you have successfully done some analysis with Python, NumPy, pandas, and matplotlib installed, and you have to run a Python script
- If you are the only one working on the project, you can probably just run it in your local environment. But ask yourself:
  - What packages/libraries do I need to load?
  - What OS am I using? (Will this work on my collaborator’s system?)
  - What are the steps to reproduce my results?

- However, it is better to use a [package manager to declare your dependencies]{.alert}
- [It's a single file describing the necessary dependencies]{.alert}, which can be used to install all dependencies in one step
- [Store the file in the repository root (main folder)]{.alert}
- The file depends on the environment/package manager you want to use:
  - For `conda` (python and R): generate an `environment.yml` file
  - For `pip` (python only): generate a `requirements.txt` file
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- `environment.yml` (for `conda`)
  - Used by conda to create an environment populated by specific packages and languages
  - Generate it with `conda env export -f environment.yml`
  - `-f` is a flag for "file"
  - If you would like to know more about conda environments, see [this quick intro](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)
  - Or get the full story in the [conda documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)

- `requirements.txt` (for `pip`)
  - Generate it with `pip freeze | grep -v 'file://' > requirements.txt`
  - Install dependencies declared with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - `-r` is a flag for "requirements"
  - Let's see some examples

# Virtual environments 🌐 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Conda: `environment.yml` file

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 21px;"}
- [Conda environments](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) allow you to create isolated environments with specific versions of packages
- [Each environment can have its own dependencies]{.alert}, and you can switch between them easily
- As they are isolated from each other, you can have different versions of the same package in different environments, and you can share the environment file with others
- They are probably the [most user-friendly]{.alert} way to manage dependencies in Python, and are widely used in data science
- Here's how to create one:

```{verbatim}
conda create --name datasci350 python=3.12 -y
conda activate datasci350
conda install numpy matplotlib pandas -y

# Or in one line:
conda create --name datasci350 python=3.12 numpy matplotlib pandas -y

# Check current environment and installed packages
conda info --envs && conda list
```

- You can create any file in the environment, e.g., a `scripts` folder (but it won't be shared with others)

```{verbatim}
cd $(conda info --base)/envs/datasci350
mkdir scripts
echo "print('Hello, world!')" > scripts/hello.py
```
:::

## Conda: `environment.yml` file

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 23px;"}
- To create an `environment.yml` file, you can use the following command (you can create the file in any folder, e.g., your Desktop):

```{verbatim}
conda env export --name datasci350 --file ~/Desktop/environment.yml
```

- This will create a file with the following content:

## What are build strings?

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 20px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- In conda, a [build](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/build.html) refers to [a specific compiled binary version of a package]{.alert}
- Even when software has the same version number, it can be compiled differently for different platforms, Python versions, or with different features enabled
- A full conda package specification has four components:

```{verbatim}
numpy=1.21.5=py39h12345_0
└──┬─┘└─┬──┘ └────┬───┘└┬┘
   │    │         │     │
   │    │         │     └─ Build number (0)
   │    │         └─────── Build string (py39h12345)
   │    └───────────────── Version (1.21.5)
   └────────────────────── Package name (numpy)
```

- The [`--no-builds` flag]{.alert} excludes build numbers from package specifications, making environment files [more portable across different platforms and operating systems]{.alert}
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- The build string (`py39h12345`) encodes important metadata:
  - [Python version:]{.alert} `py39`, `py310`
  - [Architecture:]{.alert} `linux_64`, `osx_arm64`
  - [Compiler:]{.alert} `gcc9` (GNU/Linux), `clang` (macOS)
  - [Features:]{.alert} `nomkl` (Intel), `cuda` (NVIDIA GPUs)

- Why do builds exist, then?
  - [Platform-specific compilation:]{.alert} Software must be compiled differently for different operating systems
  - [Python version compatibility:]{.alert} Packages are compiled against specific Python versions
  - [Optional features & dependencies:]{.alert} Different builds can enable/disable features
  - [Compiler variations:]{.alert} Different compilers produce different binaries

## Conda: `environment.yml` file

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 20px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- So far, so good! But what if you want to share your environment with someone else?
- You can do that by simply sharing the `environment.yml` file with them (or by uploading it to your repository!)
- They can then create the same environment on their machine by running the following command:

```{verbatim}
conda env create --file environment.yml

Channels:
 - defaults
Platform: osx-arm64
Collecting package metadata (repodata.json): done
Solving environment: done

Downloading and Extracting Packages:

Preparing transaction: done
Verifying transaction: done
Executing transaction: done
#
# To activate this environment, use
#
#     $ conda activate datasci350
#
# To deactivate an active environment, use
#
#     $ conda deactivate

(base) 
```
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- This will create a new environment called `datasci350` with the same packages and versions as the original environment
- They can then activate the environment and run the code (if they have the necessary files) by running:

```{verbatim}
conda activate datasci350
python scripts/hello.py
```

- To delete the environment, they can run:

```{verbatim}
conda deactivate
conda env remove --name datasci350
```

- And you're done! 🎉

## Pip: `requirements.txt` file

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 23px;"}
- If you are using `pip` instead of `conda`, you can generate a `requirements.txt` file with the following command:

```{verbatim}
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

- This will create a file with the following content:

## Making `requirements.txt` more portable

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 18px;"}
- However, `pip freeze` often includes [local file paths]{.alert} that won't work on other machines
- To create a truly portable `requirements.txt`, we need to [remove these local paths]{.alert}
- The easiest way is to use `grep` to filter out lines containing `file://`

```{verbatim}
# Remove local file paths from requirements.txt
pip freeze | grep -v 'file://' > clean-requirements.txt

# Or if you already have a requirements.txt with local paths:
grep -v 'file://' requirements.txt > clean-requirements.txt
```

- What this command does:
  - `pip freeze`: Lists all installed packages
  - `grep -v 'file://'`: Excludes lines containing `file://`
  - `> clean-requirements.txt`: Saves the result to a new file

- Before:
```{verbatim}
Bottleneck @ file:///private/var/folders/.../bottleneck_1731058642212/work
contourpy @ file:///Users/builder/.../contourpy_1701814001737/work
matplotlib==3.9.2
numpy @ file:///tmp/build/.../numpy-1.26.4-cp312-cp312-macosx_11_0_arm64.whl
pandas==2.2.2
```

- After (portable):
```{verbatim}
matplotlib==3.9.2
pandas==2.2.2
```
:::

## Pip: `requirements.txt` file

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 26px;"}
- To install the dependencies, you can run:

```{verbatim}
pip install -r clean-requirements.txt
```

- And that's all there is to it! 😊
- It works in a similar way to `conda`, and it is also widely used in the Python community
- However, it is not as user-friendly as `conda`, and it does not manage environments as well (it only installs packages in the current environment)
- You can also use `pipenv` to manage your dependencies
- Let's see how it works in the next slide 🤓
:::

## `pipenv` 🐍

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 18px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) is a modern package manager for Python that combines `pip` and `virtualenv` into a single tool
- It automatically creates and manages virtual environments for your projects

```{verbatim}
# Install pipenv
pip install pipenv

# Create project directory and navigate to it
mkdir datasci350
cd datasci350

# Install packages (creates Pipfile automatically)
pipenv install numpy pandas matplotlib

# Activate the virtual environment
pipenv shell

# Run commands without activating
pipenv run python script.py

# Install development dependencies
pipenv install pytest --dev
```
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- [`Pipfile`:]{.alert} Human-readable file with direct dependencies (TOML format)
- [`Pipfile.lock`:]{.alert} Auto-generated with exact versions and hashes (JSON format)

- Example Pipfile:
```{toml}
[[source]]
url = "https://pypi.org/simple"

[packages]
numpy = ">=1.20.0"
pandas = ">=2.0.0"
matplotlib = "~=3.5.0"

[dev-packages]
pytest = "*"
black = "*"

[requires]
python_version = "3.12"
```

## What are software containers?

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 22px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- [Containers](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container) are a way to package software in a format that can run on any system
- They are similar to [virtual machines](https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/virtual-machine) (VMs), but they are more lightweight and portable
- A virtual machine runs a full operating system, while [a container runs only the necessary libraries and dependencies](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container) to run the application
- They are also [one step up from virtual environments]{.alert}, as they package the entire computer environment, not just the dependencies and code
- That means that you can run your code on [any system that has Docker installed]{.alert}, regardless of the operating system or the hardware
- Talk about reproducibility! 😊
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- Containers are created using containerisation tools such as [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/singularity/)
- They are usually just [a stripped-down version of Linux]{.alert} with the necessary libraries and dependencies
- Why Linux? [You already know the answer by now!]{.alert} Because it is open-source, and it is the most widely used operating system in the world (really!)
- The Linux distribution of choice is usually our familiar [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) or [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/), which is even more lightweight
- Containers are usually stored in a [container registry](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container-registry) such as [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/), so you can share them with others too

## What is Docker? 🐳

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 19px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is the leading containerisation platform, especially in industry
- The main entities in Docker are [containers](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container), [images](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container), and [registries](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container-registry)
- [A container]{.alert}, as we have just seen, is an executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application
- [An image is a snapshot of a container]{.alert}. Images are created with the `build` command, and they will produce a container when started with `run`. More about the distinction [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23735149/what-is-the-difference-between-a-docker-image-and-a-container)
- [A registry]{.alert} is a collection of repositories from which you can pull images
- Docker has very similar syntax to Git and Linux, so Docker should feel natural (though you should still read the docs!)
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- To install Docker, you can follow the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) is the easiest way to get started with Docker on Windows and macOS, and it includes everything you need to run Docker on your machine
- It is a good idea to create an account too, as you can use it to store your images in [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)
- After you have installed and started Docker, you can run the following commands to check if it is working:

```{verbatim}
docker info
docker run hello-world

Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world

## Let's create our first container 🐳

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 22px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="70%"}
- Docker can seem [a little daunting]{.alert} at first
- We need to create and configure a `Dockerfile` to build an image, which is a [plain-text recipe that will build from scratch everything you need to recreate a project]{.alert}
- It is just [a text file that you can put under version control]{.alert}. No extension is needed, it's usually just called `Dockerfile`
- However, in most cases [you do not need to start from scratch]{.alert}
- [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) has thousands of images that you can use as a base for your project, and it is very likely that someone has already created an image similar to the one you need
- For example, as of today there are [~8,500 images of data science tools](https://hub.docker.com/search?categories=Data+Science) in Docker Hub
- But we will build one today, just to see how it works 😊
- Our next class will be a hands-on session on Docker, so we will have plenty of time to practice how to build containers from scratch or from existing images 😉

## Dockerfile

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 20px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- A `Dockerfile` is a text file that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image
- Using `docker build`, we can create an automated build that executes several command-line instructions in succession
- Let's first create a directory called `docker` and a file called `Dockerfile` inside it

```{verbatim}
mkdir docker
cd docker
touch Dockerfile
```

- We will use an official Python image as a base, and install some packages on top of it. Here: <https://hub.docker.com/_/python>
- Then we will write code that installs some Python packages and runs a Python script
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- The syntax is quite straightforward: 
  - `FROM <image_name>:<tag>` is the base image, `RUN` is used to run bash commands while building the image, and `CMD` is used to specify which commands to run when the container starts
- [The full list of instructions is available here](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/)

```{verbatim}
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3

# Install libraries
RUN pip install numpy pandas matplotlib

# Add a script
RUN echo "print('Hello, DATASCI350!')" > hello.py

# Run the script
CMD ["python", "hello.py"]
```

- We build the image with the following command (`-t` is for "tag", which names the image `datasci350-example`, and `.` is the current directory):

```{verbatim}
docker build -t datasci350-example .
```

## Let's run and share the container! 🏃‍♂️

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 20px;"}
- To run the container, we can use the following command:

```{verbatim}
docker run datasci350-example

Hello, DATASCI350!
(base)
```
 
- Woo-hoo! 🎉 😂
- We have successfully created a container with Python, numpy, pandas, and matplotlib installed, and we have run a Python script
- If you want to share your image with others, you can upload it to Docker Hub: <https://hub.docker.com/>
- First, you need to log in 

```{verbatim}
docker login
```

- Then you can tag your image with your Docker Hub username:

```{verbatim}
docker tag datasci350-example danilofreire/datasci350-example:latest
```

- And finally, you can push the image to Docker Hub:

```{verbatim}
docker push danilofreire/datasci350-example:latest
```
:::

## And here it is:

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 20px; text-align: center;"}
Link: <https://hub.docker.com/r/danilofreire/datasci350-example>

![](figures/docker-hub-image.png){width='90%'}
:::

## Docker pull

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 22px;"}
- Now that the image is on Docker Hub, anyone can pull it and run it on their machine
- To do that, they just need to run the following command:

```{verbatim}
docker pull danilofreire/datasci350-example:latest
```

- And then they can run the container with:

```{verbatim}
docker run danilofreire/datasci350-example:latest
```

- And that's it! 😊
- That's how easy it is to share your work with others using Docker
- You can also use Docker to run your code on a server, or to create a reproducible environment for your work
- Although our example here is extremely simple, you can build [anything you can imagine with Docker!]{.alert}
- Hopefully, one day researchers will require that all code is shared in a Docker container 🤓
- ... and now you know how to do it!

## Summary 

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 19px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="30%"}
- Dependency management is more important than people think
- It is the first step towards reproducibility and transparency
- You can use `conda`, `pip`, or `pipenv` to manage your dependencies in Python
- Docker offers a more comprehensive solution to the reproducibility crisis
- None of them are particularly difficult to use, and they can save you a lot of time and headaches in the future
- In the next class, we will have a hands-on session on Docker, so you can practice building containers and running them on your machine
