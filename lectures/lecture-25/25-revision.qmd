# Computational literacy 💻 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## From human computers to the silicon age

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
* The concept of 'computing' evolved significantly over time
* Initially, 'computers' were people performing calculations, often aided by tools like the abacus
* Mechanical calculators emerged, like Leibniz's machine capable of basic arithmetic
* The invention of the [transistor]{.alert}, [integrated circuits]{.alert}, and [microprocessors]{.alert} during the [silicon age]{.alert} led to the electronic computers we use today
* Most modern computers follow the [Von Neumann architecture]{.alert}, which stores both program instructions and data in the same memory space, accessed via a central processing unit (CPU)

## Representing data: Binary, hex, and decimal

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 23px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
* Computers represent all information using the [binary]{.alert} system (base 2), consisting of only 0s and 1s
* These correspond to the physical on/off states of transistors
* A single binary digit is a [bit]{.alert}
* Eight bits form a [byte]{.alert}, a common unit for storing data like characters
* [Hexadecimal (base 16)]{.alert} uses digits 0-9 and A-F as a shorthand for binary, where each hex digit represents four bits (e.g., `FF` is `11111111` binary, 255 decimal)
* Often used for representing colours (`#FF0000`) or memory addresses concisely

## Encoding information: Text and images

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 22px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
* Computers need to encode information in a way they can process
* [Abstraction]{.alert} allows us to map complex data types to numerical representations
* Digital images are grids of [pixels]{.alert} 
* Each pixel's colour is typically defined using the [RGB model]{.alert}, specifying intensities (0-255) for Red, Green, and Blue light
* Text is encoded by assigning a unique number to each character:
    * [ASCII]{.alert} was an early standard, sufficient for basic English but limited (7 or 8 bits)
    * [Unicode (UTF-8)]{.alert} is the modern, universal standard supporting virtually all characters and symbols, using variable byte lengths (1-4 bytes typically)

## Programming languages: Low-level vs high-level ⌨️

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 21px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="55%"}
Languages bridge the gap between human instructions and machine execution:

* [Machine Code]{.alert}: Raw binary instructions the CPU executes directly
* [Assembly Language]{.alert}: A [low-level]{.alert} language using mnemonics for machine instructions; specific to a CPU architecture, offering fine control but poor portability
* [High-Level Languages]{.alert} (e.g., Python, R, Java): Use more human-readable syntax, abstracting hardware details. They are more portable but require translation (compilation or interpretation)
* [Translation Methods]{.alert}:
    * [Compiled]{.alert} (e g, C++): Entire source code translated to machine code *before* running, often faster execution
    * [Interpreted]{.alert} (e g, Python): Code executed line-by-line *during runtime* by an interpreter, often easier development

## Understanding the shell

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 20px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
* The [Operating System (OS)]{.alert} is an intermediary between hardware and software
* Its core is the [Kernel]{.alert}, managing hardware access and resources
* Applications run in the [User Space]{.alert}, separate from the kernel for stability and security
* A [Shell]{.alert} (like Bash or Zsh) is a command-line interpreter program that allows you to interact with the OS by typing commands
* You access the shell via a [Terminal]{.alert} application, which handles input and output
  
:::{style="text-align: center;"}

# Git & GitHub 💾 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Version control fundamentals

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 22px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
* [Problem]{.alert}: Managing project evolution manually is chaotic 😂
* [Solution]{.alert}: Version Control Systems (VCS) like [Git]{.alert}, where every change is tracked
* [Benefits]{.alert}: Allows reverting to previous states, understanding project history, collaborating effectively, and providing backups
* [Core Workflow]{.alert}:
  - Modify files in the [Working Directory]{.alert}
  - Select changes for the next snapshot using `git add <file>` (moves changes to the [Staging Area]{.alert})
  - Record the snapshot into the project history using `git commit -m "message"` (creates a [commit]{.alert} in the local [Repository]{.alert})
* Key commands: `git status`, `git add`, `git checkout`, `git commit`, `git diff`, `git log`, `git pull`, `git push`

## Branching & merging 🌿

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 21px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
* [Version control]{.alert} is not just about tracking changes; it's also about managing different lines of development
* [Branches]{.alert} are a core Git concept allowing independent lines of development
* Work on new features or bug fixes in isolation without affecting the main (`main`/`master`) branch
* [Workflow]{.alert}: Create a branch (`git checkout -b feature-x`), make commits, then merge back into main (`git checkout main`, `git merge feature-x`)
* [Merge Conflicts]{.alert}: Occur when changes on different branches affect the same lines; Git requires manual resolution before the merge can complete
* [Pull Requests (PRs)]{.alert}: The standard GitHub workflow for proposing merges, enabling code review and discussion before integrating changes

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 23px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="55%"}
Basic workflow:

* [Write Dockerfile]{.alert}: Define environment setup (base OS, package installs, code copying, run command)
* [Build Image]{.alert}: `docker build -t myimage:latest .` (creates the image locally)
* [Run Container]{.alert}: `docker run -p 8888:8888 -v $(pwd):/app myimage:latest` (starts the container)
    * `-p`: Port mapping (host:container)
    * `-v`: Volume mounting (host:container) for data persistence/code access
    * `-it`: Interactive terminal
* [Share]{.alert}: `docker push`, `docker pull` (via a registry like Docker Hub)
