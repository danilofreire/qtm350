# Hello, everyone! <br> Hope all is well! üòä {background-color="#2d4563"}

# Brief recap üìö {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Last time, we discussed:

:::{style="magin-top: 40px; font-size: 24px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- The impact of the [Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) architecture in natural language processing
- How LLMs are trained, the role of self-attention, and the importance of pre-training
- How LLMs are perhaps the ultimate high-level language, capable of generating code, text, images, and movies from a prompt
- The limitations of LLMs, including the need for large amounts of data and computational resources, and the ethical dilemmas they raise (poorly paid workers, potential for misuse, bias, etc.)
- The potential of LLMs to revolutionise and democratise programming, with tools like [GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/) and [OpenAI Codex](https://openai.com/research/codex/)

# Copilot or not Copilot? ü§î {background-color="#2d4563"}

## A short overview of existing AI coding tools
### Claude 

:::{style="margin-top: 40px; font-size: 22px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- [Claude Sonnet](https://claude.ai/) is [top-tier LLM]{.alert}, often better than ChatGPT and Copilot for many tasks
- It is a [paid service]{.alert}, free plan offers little
- Cons: does not have access to the internet and it is not integrated into an IDE
- Pros: it is [very powerful]{.alert} and can generate code, text, and more. It also has a very cool feature called [Artifacts](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/9945615-intro-to-artifacts) that allows you to write and edit code together with the AI
- It one of the best tools for generating code, especially for more complex tasks
- [Try it out](https://claude.ai/)

### Cursor

:::{style="margin-top: 40px; font-size: 22px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- [Cursor](https://cursor.com/) is the new kid on the block
- It is not only an LLM, but a whole editor (in fact, it's a fork of VS Code)
  - So your extensions should work with it
- It has [one of the best]{.alert} code completion I've seen so far, and it includes a chatbot too
- Cursor, like Codeium and Copilot, can scan your whole codebase and suggest improvements
- It also has a "Privacy Mode" that does not send your code to the cloud
- It's paid, but it offers a (limited) free plan
  - 2000 completions per month
  - 1 workspace
  - 1 user

## A short overview of existing AI coding tools
### DeepSeek

:::{style="margin-top: 40px; font-size: 22px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- I have been impressed with [DeepSeek](https://deepseek.com/), a new LLM that is open source, very powerful and [super cheap]{.alert}
- [Their chatbot is completely free](https://chat.deepseek.com/), and you can use it to generate code, text, and more
- In my experience, it is almost as good as [Claude 3.5 Sonnet]{.alert} (but it costs about 50x less!)
- But what makes it really shine is its [API](https://platform.deepseek.com)
- You can put just a few dollars in your account and get an API key to use it in your projects
- [I strongly recommend]{.alert} you to try it out
- [Read the technical report here](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3/blob/main/DeepSeek_V3.pdf). GitHub repository: <https://github.com/deepseek-ai>
- (Did I say it is cheap?)

## A short overview of existing AI coding tools
### Cline (+ LLMs)

:::{style="margin-top: 40px; font-size: 21px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- [Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline) is a new tool that uses any LLM, including DeepSeek, to generate code
- It is free, open source, and has more than 20k stars on GitHub!
- It is [really, really good]{.alert}: it goes beyond Copilot and implements [AI Agents](https://www-cdn.anthropic.com/fed9cc193a14b84131812372d8d5857f8f304c52/Model_Card_Claude_3_Addendum.pdf) to help you with any project you have
- Cline works well with [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=saoudrizwan.claude-dev), and it can be expanded with [Model Context Protocols](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol)
- You need an API key from any LLM to use it, and I recommend DeepSeek as it costs almost _nada_ üòÇ
  - [Mistral's Codestral](https://console.mistral.ai/codestral) is actually free to use with AI Agents
- Learning about Cline would take much more than a few minutes in class, but I recommend you to check it out
- For those who are willing to [really]{.alert} integrate AI in your code, this is a great tool to start with

# Installing GitHub Copilot in the command line üñ•Ô∏è {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Step 1: Install GitHub CLI

:::{style="margin-top: 40px; font-size: 21px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- To use GitHub Copilot in the CLI, you need:
  - An active GitHub Copilot subscription
  - GitHub CLI installed
  - The Copilot CLI extension

- MacOS and Linux users can install [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```{verbatim}
brew install gh
```

- Windows users can install GitHub CLI with [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/):

```{verbatim}
choco install gh
```

- Or download the [GitHub CLI installer](https://cli.github.com/)

- To install the extension, run:

```{verbatim}
gh extension install github/copilot-cli
```
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
:::{style="text-align: center;"}
![](figures/gh-cli.png)

<https://cli.github.com/>
:::
:::
:::
:::

## Step 2: Authenticate with GitHub

:::{style="margin-top: 40px; font-size: 21px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- To authenticate with GitHub, run:

```{verbatim}
gh auth login
```

- Follow the instructions to authenticate with GitHub. Select `GitHub.com`

```{verbatim}
‚ùØ gh auth login
? Where do you use GitHub?  [Use arrows to move, type to filter]
> GitHub.com
  Other
```

- You will be asked to open a browser and authenticate with GitHub. Select `HTTPS`

```{verbatim}
‚ùØ gh auth login
? Where do you use GitHub? GitHub.com
? What is your preferred protocol for Git operations on this host?  [Use arrows to move, type to filter]
> HTTPS
  SSH
```
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}

```{verbatim}
? Authenticate Git with your GitHub credentials? (Y/n) Y
```

- You will be asked to login

```{verbatim}
? How would you like to authenticate GitHub CLI?  [Use arrows to move, type to filter]
> Login with a web browser
  Paste an authentication token
```

- Copy the code and press `Enter` to go to the browser. Press `Continue`, paste the code, and click on `Authorize`

```{verbatim}
! First copy your one-time code: 1111-AAAA
Press Enter to open github.com in your browser... 
```

- If successful, you will see:

```{verbatim}
‚úì Authentication complete.
- gh config set -h github.com git_protocol https
‚úì Configured git protocol
‚úì Logged in as danilofreire
```

- And you're done! üéâ
:::
:::
:::

## Step 3: Use Copilot in the CLI

:::{style="margin-top: 40px; font-size: 21px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- Now that you have `gh` installed, you can use Copilot in the CLI
- [To install Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/configure-personal-settings/installing-github-copilot-in-the-cli), run:

```{verbatim}
gh extension install github/gh-copilot
```

- And you should be ready to go! üöÄ
- GitHub Copilot in the CLI offers two primary commands
  - [Explain Command]{.alert}: Use `gh copilot explain` followed by a command to get an explanation
  - [Suggest Command]{.alert}: Use `gh copilot suggest` followed by a prompt to generate code
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- You can also create [aliases]{.alert} for these commands. For example:
  - `ghce` for `gh copilot explain`
  - `ghcs` for `gh copilot suggest`

- If you use `zsh`, you can just copy the commands below in your terminal:

```{verbatim}
echo 'eval "$(gh copilot alias -- zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc
```

- Or if you use `bash`:

```{verbatim}
echo 'eval "$(gh copilot alias -- bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
```

- Windows PowerShell users can use:

```{verbatim}
$GH_COPILOT_PROFILE = Join-Path -Path $(Split-Path -Path $PROFILE -Parent) -ChildPath "gh-copilot.ps1"
gh copilot alias -- pwsh | Out-File ( New-Item -Path $GH_COPILOT_PROFILE -Force )
echo ". `"$GH_COPILOT_PROFILE`"" >> $PROFILE
```

- And you're all set! üéâ

- Let's see some examples!

# Cool, isn't it? ü§© {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Let's see what Copilot can do for you in VS Code

:::{style="margin-top: 40px; font-size: 21px;"}
- If you have installed Copilot in VS Code, just click on the Copilot icon (a chat bubble) in the bottom left corner
- You can then type a prompt and see the suggestions. As you know how to ask it to generate code (same as in ChatGPT), let's see other things that Copilot can do for you
- Type `/help` to see the available commands
- You will also note that there are commands such as `@workspace`, `@vscode`, `@terminal`, and `@github` that allow you to interact with the workspace, VS Code, the terminal, and GitHub (including your account), respectively
- You can also interact with files with `#file`
- Let's have a look at some examples
:::

## Example 04: Explain code ü§î

:::{style="margin-top: 40px; font-size: 21px;"}
- Type `/explain` followed by a code snippet to get an explanation. You can select the snippet directly in the terminal, then just type `/explain`

:::{style="text-align: center;"}
![](figures/copilot-explain.png){width="80%"}
:::
:::

## Example 05: Run tests üß™

:::{style="margin-top: 40px; font-size: 21px;"}
- Type `/tests` followed by a code snippet to run tests
- Let's see how it tests this function:

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
class SimpleCalculator:
    def add(self, a, b):
        return a + b

    def subtract(self, a, b):
        return a - b

    def multiply(self, a, b):
        return a * b

    def divide(self, a, b):
        if b == 0:
            raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero")
        return a / b

    def square_root(self, a):
        if a < 0:
            raise ValueError("Cannot calculate square root of a negative number")
        return a ** 0.5

```

## Example 05: Run tests üß™

:::{style="margin-top: 40px; font-size: 21px; text-align: center;"}
![](figures/copilot-tests.png){width="80%"}
:::

## Example 06: Fix code üõ†Ô∏è

:::{style="margin-top: 40px; font-size: 21px;"}
- Type `/fix` followed by a code snippet to fix it
- This function is supposed to check if a number is even, but it has a logical error. The division operation `(number / 2)` should be replaced with the modulo operation `(number % 2)`
- If you hoover over the `Fixed Code` block, you will see the options: 
  - Apply the fix in the editor
  - Insert the fixed code at the cursor
  - Copy the fixed code to the clipboard
  - Insert into a terminal
  - Insert into a new file

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
def is_even(number):
    return number / 2 == 0
```
:::

## Example 06: Fix code üõ†

:::{style="margin-top: 40px; font-size: 21px; text-align: center;"}
![](figures/copilot-fix.png){width="80%"}
:::

## Example 07: Create new file and generate text/code üöÄ

:::{style="margin-top: 40px; font-size: 21px;"}
- Type `/new` and pass the information about the file you want to create
- `/new create a file.txt file with the first three lines of Homer's Odyssey`

:::{style="text-align: center;"}
![](figures/copilot-new.png){width="90%"}
:::
:::

## Example 08: Run code üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

:::{style="margin-top: 40px; font-size: 21px;"}
- You can use the `@terminal` command to write and run code in the terminal. Click on the terminal icon to insert the code
- `@terminal create a file titled test.py and add print("Hello, world!") using the command line`

:::{style="text-align: center;"}
![](figures/copilot-terminal.png){width="90%"}
:::
:::

## Example 09: Interact with GitHub üêô

:::{style="margin-top: 40px; font-size: 21px;"}
- You can use the `@github` command to interact with GitHub
- For example, let's see what are the latest 3 commits of this repository (`danilofreire/qtm350`)
- You can also use `@github` to create a new repository, open a pull request, and more

:::{style="text-align: center;"}
![](figures/copilot-github.png){width="90%"}
:::
:::

## Example 10: Interact with VS Code üöÄ

:::{style="margin-top: 40px; font-size: 21px;"}
- You can use the `@vscode` command to interact with VS Code
- For example, let's see how to open a new file in the editor

:::{style="text-align: center;"}
![](figures/copilot-vscode.png){width="90%"}
:::
:::

## Example 11: Interact with the workspace üíª

:::{style="margin-top: 40px; font-size: 21px;"}
- The `@workspace` command allows you to interact with the workspace, which are the files and folders you have open in VS Code
- For example, let's ask it to list the files in the workspace

:::{style="text-align: center;"}
![](figures/copilot-workspace.png){width="90%"}
:::
:::

## Example 11: Interact with the workspace üíª

:::{style="margin-top: 40px; font-size: 21px;"}

- Click on the icons and they will open!

:::{style="text-align: center;"}
![](figures/copilot-workspace02.png){width="90%"}
:::
:::

## Last Example: Searching for text in files üìÑ

:::{style="margin-top: 40px; font-size: 21px;"}
- You can use the `#file` command to search for text in files
- Combine it with the `@workspace` command to search in all files in the workspace
- Let's search for Python code in this file

:::{style="text-align: center;"}

## Summary

:::{style="margin-top: 40px; font-size: 22px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- GitHub Copilot can save you a lot of time and make you more productive (and it's fun!)
- It is not perfect, but it is a good tool as it is ü§ì
- You should also have a look at other AI coding tools, and I recommend you to try [Cline](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=saoudrizwan.claude-dev) and [DeepSeek](https://deepseek.com), as they work really well and can do much more than just code generation
- Also, please read more about [AI agents](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-agents) and how [they can be used in your projects](https://blog.langchain.dev/what-is-an-agent/)
- I hope you will make good use of AI coding tools from now on ü§ñ
- Find out other uses for it, test the other tools available, and let me know what you think!
