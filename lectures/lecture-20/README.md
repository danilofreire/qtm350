# Lecture 21 - Parallel Computing with Python

This lecture covers the basics of parallel computing. We will discuss the following topics:

- Serial vs Parallel Algorithms
- Python implementations of parallelism
  - Single node
  - Multi-node
- GPU Parallelism with NVIDIA GPUs
- Tools for further exploration

The content of this lecture is based on materials provided by [the Yale Center for Research Computing](https://github.com/ycrc/parallel_python/tree/master). They have been adapted for the purposes of this course. I would like to thank the YCRC for sharing their resources.
