# Brief recap 📚 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Recap of last class and today's plan

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 26px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
### Last time we learned how to:

- Connect SQL with Python with `sqlite3` and `pandas`
- Use many SQL commands, such as `CASE WHEN`, window functions, and string functions
- Fill missing data with `COALESCE` and `CASE WHEN`
- Use `pandas` to write and run SQL queries
- Pivot tables (long to wide) in SQLite
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
### Today we will learn how to:

- See different types of joins in SQL
- Use special joins, such as `CROSS JOIN` and `SELF JOIN`
- Merge tables by row with `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, and `EXCEPT`
- Learn how to create `UPSERT` statements in SQLite
- Create `VIEWS` in SQLite
- Solve exercises to practice what we learned
- Let's get started! 🚀

# Basic joins 📊 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Primary and foreign keys

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 20px;"}
- As with many languages, you can merge two tables in SQL either [by columns or by rows]{.alert}
- The most common method is the `JOIN` clause
- `JOIN` is used to [combine rows and columns from two or more tables]{.alert} based on a related column between them
- As you know, there are two types of keys, [primary and foreign keys]{.alert}
- The [primary key]{.alert} is a column that [uniquely identifies each row in a table]{.alert}
- A [foreign key]{.alert} is a column that [identifies a column in another table]{.alert}
  - One table can have [multiple foreign keys, and they can be `NULL`]{.alert}
  - SQLite supports foreign keys, and the Python `sqlite3` module handles them correctly by default

## Load the libraries and connect to the database {#sec:tables}

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 23px;"}
- Let's load the libraries and connect to the SQLite database. We'll use a file named `lecture19.db`.

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
import pandas as pd; import sqlite3

# Connect to the SQLite database (this will create the file if it doesn't exist)
connection = sqlite3.connect('lecture19.db'); cursor = connection.cursor()

cursor.execute('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS players;')
cursor.execute('''
CREATE TABLE players (
    player_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, player_name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    goals INT NOT NULL, victories INT NOT NULL
);
''')

cursor.execute('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS teams;')
cursor.execute('''
CREATE TABLE teams (
    team_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, team_name TEXT NOT NULL
);
''')
connection.commit() # Commit changes
```
:::

## Create the tables

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 22px;"}
- Now let's insert some data into the tables!

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
# Insert data into the tables
cursor.execute('''
INSERT INTO players (player_name, goals, victories) VALUES
('Messi', 10, 5),
('Vini Jr', 8, 4),
('Neymar', 6, 3),
('Mbappé', 5, 2),
('Lewandowski', 4, 1),
('Haaland', 5, 3);
''')

cursor.execute('''
INSERT INTO teams (team_name) VALUES
('Inter Miami'),
('Real Madrid'),
('Santos'),
('Real Madrid'),
('Barcelona');
''')
connection.commit() # Commit changes
```
:::

## Visualise the tables

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 20px;"}
- Let's see our tables using `pandas` 🐼
- `read_sql` works fine with the `sqlite3` connection object!

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM players', connection)
```

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM teams', connection)
```
:::

## Types of joins

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 20px; text-align: center;"}
![](figures/joins.webp){width="80%"}
:::

## Inner join

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 22px;"}
- The `INNER JOIN` returns only the records where [there is a match between both tables (intersection)]{.alert} based on the join condition
- If there's no match for a record in either table, that record will be [excluded from the results]{.alert}
- The matching condition is specified in the `ON` clause (e.g., `ON table1.id = table2.id`)
- Note that Haaland (`player_id` 6) is not in the `teams` table (which only has 5 rows), so he will not appear in the result set

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
pd.read_sql('''
SELECT players.player_name, teams.team_name, players.goals, players.victories
FROM players
INNER JOIN teams
ON players.player_id = teams.team_id;
''', connection)
```
:::

## Left join

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 21px;"}
- The `LEFT JOIN` returns [all records from the left table]{.alert} (first table) and the [matched records from the right table (second table)]{.alert}
- The result is `NULL` (`None` or `NaN` in Python) for columns from the right side if there is no match
- This is perhaps [the most common type of join]{.alert}, as it keeps all the data from the table we are usually primarily interested in (the "left" table)
- Note that Haaland is included here because he is in the `players` table (the left table)

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
pd.read_sql('''
SELECT players.player_name, teams.team_name, players.goals
FROM players
LEFT JOIN teams
ON players.player_id = teams.team_id;
''', connection)
```
:::

## Right join (emulated in SQLite)

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 21px;"}
- The `RIGHT JOIN` command returns [all records from the right table]{.alert} (second table) and the [matched records from the left table]{.alert} (first table)
- [SQLite does not implement]{.alert} `RIGHT JOIN`, so we emulate it by swapping tables in a `LEFT JOIN`
  - We select from the `teams` table first, then `LEFT JOIN` the `players` table
- In our case, since `teams` has fewer rows than `players` and all `team_id`s match a `player_id`, the emulated result looks the same as the `INNER JOIN`.

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
pd.read_sql('''
SELECT players.player_name, teams.team_name, players.goals
FROM teams
LEFT JOIN players
ON players.player_id = teams.team_id;
''', connection)
```
:::

## Full outer join (emulated in SQLite)

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 21px;"}
- `FULL OUTER JOIN` returns [all records from both of them, regardless of whether there is a match in the other table]{.alert}
- Rows from either table that do not have a match in the other table will have `NULL` for the columns of the table without a match
- [SQLite also does not implement]{.alert} `FULL OUTER JOIN`. We can emulate it by taking a `LEFT JOIN` in both directions and combining with `UNION` (which removes duplicates)

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
pd.read_sql('''
SELECT players.player_id, players.player_name, teams.team_name, players.goals
FROM players
LEFT JOIN teams
ON players.player_id = teams.team_id

UNION

SELECT players.player_id, players.player_name, teams.team_name, players.goals
FROM teams
LEFT JOIN players
ON players.player_id = teams.team_id
ORDER BY players.player_id;
''', connection)
```
:::

## Try it yourself! 🧠 {#sec:exercise01a}

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 20px;"}
- Let's create two new tables (`products`, `reviews`) and insert some data into them. We use `REAL` for the price in SQLite

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
# Create the tables and insert data
cursor.execute('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS reviews;') 
cursor.execute('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS products;')
cursor.execute('''
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    product_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    price REAL 
);
''')

# Insert products
cursor.execute('''
INSERT INTO products (product_name, price) VALUES
    ('Coffee Maker', 99.99),
    ('Toaster', 29.99),
    ('Blender', 79.99),
    ('Microwave', 149.99),
    ('Air Fryer', 89.99);
''')

cursor.execute('''
CREATE TABLE reviews (
    review_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    product_id INT,
    rating INT CHECK (rating BETWEEN 1 AND 5),
    comment TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(product_id)
);
''')

# Insert reviews
cursor.execute('''
INSERT INTO reviews (product_id, rating, comment) VALUES
    (1, 5, 'Great coffee maker!'),
    (1, 4, 'Good but expensive'),
    (2, 3, 'Average toaster'),
    (3, 5, 'Best blender ever');
''')
connection.commit()
print("Tables 'products' and 'reviews' created and populated.")
```
:::

## Try it yourself! 🧠 {#sec:exercise01b}

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 28px;"}
- Now try to merge the `products` and `reviews` tables using `INNER JOIN` and `LEFT JOIN`
- Explain the differences between the two results based on which products appear
- [[Appendix 01]{.button}](#sec:appendix01)
:::

# Special joins 🌟 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Cross join

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 21px;"}
- `CROSS JOIN` is available in SQLite
- [A cross join does not use any comparisons]{.alert} (like `ON`) to match rows
- Instead, the result is constructed by pairing [every row from the first table with every row from the second table (Cartesian product)]{.alert}
- Useful for generating all possible combinations (e.g., pairing all clothing sizes with all colours)

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
# Displaying cross join between players and teams
pd.read_sql('''
SELECT players.player_name, teams.team_name
FROM players
CROSS JOIN teams
ORDER BY players.player_id, teams.team_id;
''', connection)
```
:::

## Cross join

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 20px;"}
- Another example of `CROSS JOIN`
- SQLite uses `||` for string concatenation

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
# Drop and recreate tables
cursor.execute('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS colours;')
cursor.execute('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS sizes;')
cursor.execute('CREATE TABLE colours (colour_name TEXT);')
cursor.execute('CREATE TABLE sizes (size_code TEXT);')
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO colours VALUES ('Black'), ('Red');")
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO sizes VALUES ('S'), ('M');")
connection.commit()

# Perform cross join and concatenate strings using ||
pd.read_sql('''
SELECT colours.colour_name, sizes.size_code, colours.colour_name || ' - ' || sizes.size_code as t_shirt
FROM colours
CROSS JOIN sizes
ORDER BY colours.colour_name, sizes.size_code DESC;
''', connection)
```
:::

## Self join

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 23px;"}
- A self join is when you [join a table with itself]{.alert} to find relationships between [rows in the same table]{.alert}
- But why would you do that? 🤔 
  - When data contains hierarchical relationships (manager → employee, mother → child, etc.)
- You need [two different "views" of the same table]{.alert}, so you use aliases to tell them apart
- Imagine an `employees` table, and you want to show each employee with their manager's name:

:::{style="text-align: center;"}
| employee_id | name     | manager_id |
|-------------|----------|------------|
| 1           | Alice    | NULL       |
| 2           | Bob      | 1          |
| 3           | Charlie  | 1          |
:::

- The SQL query would look like this:

```sql
SELECT e.name AS employee, m.name AS manager
FROM employees AS e          -- First "copy" for employees
LEFT JOIN employees AS m     -- Second "copy" for managers
ON e.manager_id = m.employee_id  -- Join condition
```
:::

## Self join

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 19px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="43%"}
- Let's see an example with a `family` table where `mother_id` refers back to `person_id`.

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
cursor.execute('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS family;')
cursor.execute('''
CREATE TABLE family (
    person_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT,
    mother_id INT 
);
''')

cursor.execute('''
INSERT INTO family (name, mother_id) VALUES
    ('Emma', NULL), -- grandmother (id 1)
    ('Sarah', 1),   -- Emma's daughter (id 2)
    ('Lisa', 1),    -- Emma's daughter (id 3)
    ('Tom', 2),     -- Sarah's son (id 4)
    ('Alice', 2);   -- Sarah's daughter (id 5)
''')
connection.commit()

pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM family;', connection)
```
:::

:::{.column width="57%"}
- Now we want to find each child with their mother's name using a self join

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
# Self join to find child-mother pairs
pd.read_sql('''
SELECT children.name as child, mothers.name as mother
FROM family AS children
JOIN family AS mothers ON children.mother_id = mothers.person_id
ORDER BY mothers.name;
''', connection)
```

- It matches each child to their mother by connecting the child's `mother_id` to the mother's `person_id`
- **Sarah (children) and Lisa (children):** `mother_id = 1` → **Emma (mothers):** `person_id = 1`
- **Tom (children) and Alice (children):** `mother_id = 2` → **Sarah (mothers):** `person_id = 2`
- **Emma (children):** `mother_id = NULL` → **No match in mothers table**
:::
:::
:::

## Self join

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 18px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="57%"}
- Let's see another example using the `players` table
- Here we want to compare the `goals` of every player against every other player
- We use `p1.player_id < p2.player_id` to avoid duplicate pairs (e.g., Messi vs Vini Jr. and Vini Jr. vs Messi) and comparing a player to themselves

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
pd.read_sql('''
SELECT
    p1.player_name,
    p1.goals,
    p2.player_name as compared_to,
    p2.goals as their_goals,
    p1.goals - p2.goals as difference
FROM players AS p1
JOIN players AS p2
ON p1.player_id < p2.player_id -- Avoid duplicates and self-comparison
ORDER BY difference DESC;
''', connection)
```
:::

:::{.column width="43%"}
```{python}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
pd.read_sql('''
SELECT
    p1.player_name,
    p1.goals,
    p2.player_name as compared_to,
    p2.goals as their_goals,
    p1.goals - p2.goals as difference
FROM players AS p1
JOIN players AS p2
ON p1.player_id < p2.player_id -- Avoid duplicates and self-comparison
ORDER BY difference DESC;
''', connection)
```

# Merge tables by row 🧩 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Union

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 20px;"}
- The `UNION` operator combines the result sets of [two or more `SELECT` statements vertically (stacking rows)]{.alert}
- It [automatically removes duplicate rows]{.alert} from the combined results
  - If you want to keep duplicates, use `UNION ALL`
- `UNION` is useful when:
  - Combining different tables with different structures
  - Each query needs different logic or different columns
  - You want to add categories or labels per query

- Here is an example where we categorise players based on different criteria using `UNION` (note the added `category` column):

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
# UNION example: Different categories for different criteria
pd.read_sql('''
SELECT player_name, goals, victories, 'Elite Scorer' as category
FROM players
WHERE goals > 9

UNION

SELECT player_name, goals, victories, 'Team Leader' as category
FROM players
WHERE victories > 2 AND goals < 10

ORDER BY category, player_name;
''', connection)
```
:::

## Union all and intersect

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 21px;"}
- Similar to `UNION`, `UNION ALL` also merges tables by rows (stacks results vertically)
- Unlike `UNION`, `UNION ALL` [retains all duplicate rows]{.alert} 
- It simply appends the results. It's generally faster than `UNION` as it doesn't need to check for duplicates
- Let's see an example combining players who are high scorers (more than 7 goals) and players with many victories (more than 3), keeping duplicates if a player meets both criteria:

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
# UNION ALL keeps all rows, including duplicates if a player meets both criteria.
print(pd.read_sql('''
SELECT player_name, goals, victories, 'High Scorer (>7)' AS category
FROM players
WHERE goals > 7

UNION ALL

SELECT player_name, goals, victories, 'Many Victories (>3)' AS category
FROM players
WHERE victories > 3

ORDER BY player_name, category;
''', connection))
```
:::

## Intersect

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 20px;"}
- The `INTERSECT` operator returns only the rows that are [common to the result sets of two (or more) `SELECT` statements]{.alert}
- It's useful when you need to find the overlap between two distinct lists that are [difficult to combine with a simple `AND`]{.alert}

- For instance, we want to find "Platinum" customers for a loyalty programme based on two separate tables
  - **Table 1:** `TopSpenders` (customers who spent over $500)
  - **Table 2:** `FrequentShoppers` (customers who made 10+ purchases)
  - We want to find customers who are on **both** tables

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
:::{style="text-align: center;"}
**Table: `TopSpenders`**

| customer_name |
|---------------|
| Alice         |
| Bob           |
| David         |
:::
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
:::{style="text-align: center;"}
**Table: `FrequentShoppers`**

| customer_name |
|---------------|
| Bob           |
| Charlie       |
| David         |

:::
:::
:::

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
# Create the two separate tables for our example
cursor.execute('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS TopSpenders;')
cursor.execute('CREATE TABLE TopSpenders (customer_name TEXT);')
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO TopSpenders VALUES ('Alice'), ('Bob'), ('David');")

cursor.execute('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS FrequentShoppers;')
cursor.execute('CREATE TABLE FrequentShoppers (customer_name TEXT);')
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO FrequentShoppers VALUES ('Bob'), ('Charlie'), ('David');")
connection.commit()

# Now, find the customers who are in BOTH lists
print(pd.read_sql('''
    SELECT customer_name FROM TopSpenders
    
    INTERSECT
    
    SELECT customer_name FROM FrequentShoppers;
''', connection))
```
:::

## Except

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 20px;"}
- The `EXCEPT` operator returns all rows from the [first SELECT statement that are not present in the second SELECT statement's results]{.alert}
- It finds the difference between two tables (e.g., "Give me everything in A, except for the things that are also in B")
- For example, now we want to run a "re-engagement" campaign
  - **Table 1:** `TopSpenders` (customers who spent over $500)
  - **Table 2:** `FrequentShoppers` (customers who made 10+ purchases)
  - Find customers who are `TopSpenders` but are not `FrequentShoppers` (they spent a lot once, but haven't been back)

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
:::{style="text-align: center;"}
**Table: `TopSpenders`**

| customer_name |
|---------------|
| Alice         |
| Bob           |
| David         |
:::
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
:::{style="text-align: center;"}

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
print(pd.read_sql('''
    SELECT customer_name FROM TopSpenders

    SELECT customer_name FROM FrequentShoppers;
''', connection))
```
:::

## Upsert (`INSERT ... ON CONFLICT`)

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 20px;"}
- SQLite provides `UPSERT` (Update or Insert) operations using the `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT` clause
- This allows you to attempt an `INSERT`, and if it violates a constraint (like `UNIQUE` or `PRIMARY KEY`), you should perform a `DO UPDATE SET` or a `DO NOTHING` instead
- For instance, if we try to insert a player with an existing `player_name`, we update their `goals` instead
- You will notice that `excluded` is a special table that refers to the row that would have been inserted if there was no conflict. [SQLite always uses this name]{.alert}

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
# Messi already exists, and he has 10 goals and 5 victories
# We will insert him again with 2 more goals and 1 more victory
cursor.execute(""" 
INSERT INTO players (player_name, goals, victories) 
VALUES ('Messi', 2, 1) 
ON CONFLICT(player_name) DO UPDATE SET 
    goals = goals + excluded.goals,
    victories = victories + excluded.victories;
""")

pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM players', connection)
```
:::

# Views 🔎 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Views

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 20px;"}
- A `VIEW` is a virtual table based on the result of a `SELECT` query.
- It does not store data itself but provides a way to simplify complex queries or encapsulate frequently used queries.
- You can create a view using the `CREATE VIEW` statement, followed by the view name and the `SELECT` query.
- In SQLite, you can create a view using the `CREATE VIEW` statement, and you can also drop it using `DROP VIEW`.

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
# Drop the view if it exists
cursor.execute('DROP VIEW IF EXISTS player_stats;')

# Create the view
cursor.execute('''
CREATE VIEW player_stats AS
SELECT player_name, SUM(goals) AS total_goals, SUM(victories) AS total_victories
FROM players
GROUP BY player_name;
''')
connection.commit()

pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM player_stats LIMIT 4', connection)
```
:::

## Views

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 20px;"}
- You can also use the view in a join with another table
- For example, let's create a view that combines colours and sizes to show all possible T-shirt combinations, as we did earlier
- So we can simply query `SELECT * FROM colour_size` instead of writing the `CROSS JOIN` every time!


```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
# Drop the view if it already exists to avoid errors on re-run
cursor.execute('DROP VIEW IF EXISTS colour_size;')

# Create the view using cursor.execute()
cursor.execute('''
CREATE VIEW colour_size AS
SELECT
    c.colour_name,
    s.size_code,
    c.colour_name || ' - ' || s.size_code as t_shirt -- Use || for concatenation
FROM colours AS c
CROSS JOIN sizes AS s
ORDER BY c.colour_name, s.size_code DESC;
''')
connection.commit() # Commit the view creation

# Now showcase the view by querying it with pandas
pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM colour_size;', connection)
```

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 25px;"}
- Today we learned about different types of joins in SQL (`INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `FULL OUTER`), noting that SQLite does not support `RIGHT` and `FULL OUTER` joins natively
- We also learned about special joins: `CROSS JOIN` for combinations and `SELF JOIN` for relating rows within the same table
- We saw how to merge tables vertically (by row) with `UNION`, `UNION ALL`, `INTERSECT`, and `EXCEPT`
- We also saw how SQLite implements `UPSERT` functionality using `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT` and how to update existing records (`DO UPDATE SET`) or `DO NOTHING` on conflicts
- We saw how to create and use `VIEWS` in SQLite, which are virtual tables based on `SELECT` queries

- Here is the solution to the exercise comparing `INNER JOIN` and `LEFT JOIN` for `products` and `reviews`.

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
print("INNER JOIN Results (Only products with reviews):")
# INNER JOIN only includes products that have at least one review.
# Products like 'Microwave' and 'Air Fryer' are excluded.
print(pd.read_sql('''
    SELECT p.product_name, r.rating, r.comment
    FROM products p
    INNER JOIN reviews r ON p.product_id = r.product_id
    ORDER BY p.product_id, r.review_id; -- Added review_id for consistent ordering
''', connection))
```

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
print("\nLEFT JOIN Results (All products, reviews where available):")
print(pd.read_sql('''
    SELECT p.product_name, r.rating, r.comment
    FROM products p
    LEFT JOIN reviews r ON p.product_id = r.product_id
    ORDER BY p.product_id, r.review_id;
''', connection))

## Appendix 02 {#sec:appendix02}

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 20px;"}
- Here is the solution to the self-join exercise comparing player victories.
- Note the use of `CAST(... AS REAL)` or multiplying by `1.0` to ensure floating-point division in SQLite.

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
print("Self Join on Players to Compare Victories:")
print(pd.read_sql('''
SELECT
    p1.player_name,
    p1.victories,
    p2.player_name AS compared_to,
    p2.victories AS their_victories,
    -- Ensure floating point division by casting one operand to REAL or NUMERIC
    ROUND(CAST(p1.victories AS REAL) / p2.victories, 2) AS victories_ratio
FROM players p1
JOIN players p2
    ON p1.player_id < p2.player_id -- Avoid duplicates and self-comparison
WHERE
    p2.victories > 0 -- Avoid division by zero
ORDER BY
    p1.player_id, p2.player_id; -- Consistent ordering
''', connection))
```

### Cleaning the SQLite database

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 22px;"}
- Unlike server-based databases like PostgreSQL, SQLite databases are typically single files.
- "Cleaning" the database often means simply deleting the database file and starting fresh.
- If you encounter issues, the easiest way to reset is to close any active connections to the database file and then remove the file using your operating system or Python's `os` module.

- Here's how you can close the connection and delete the database file (`lecture19.db`) we used in this lecture using Python:

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
# Ensure the connection is closed first
try:
    connection.close()
    print("SQLite connection closed.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error closing connection (might be already closed): {e}")
```
