:::

Now it's your turn! 😉

Please introduce yourself! 👋

Tell us your name, your major, one thing you really like, and something we don't know about your city or country! 🌍

## My teaching philosophy

:::{style="margin-top: 60px;"}
:::

- I love teaching and aim to make learning fun 
- Classes where students participate are the best
- Hands-on activities help you learn better
- I am always available to help and answer questions. And I mean it
- Your feedback helps me improve my teaching. Please let me know what is working and what is not

## Teaching assistants

:::{style="margin-top: 60px;"}
:::

- The teaching assistants for this course are Alix Morales and Harris Wang

- Alix will be answering questions during our lectures and holding office hours. You can reach out to him via email at <alix.morales@emory.edu>

- Harris will also be grading your assignments and quizzes (with my oversight). His email address is <harris.wang@emory.edu>

- We are all here to help you! So feel free to ask questions during class, office hours, or via email 😃

## Office hours
### What for and what not for

:::{style="margin-top: 60px;"}
:::

- What office hours are meant for:
  - Applying tools in practice
  - Discussion of issues related to the assignments
  - Boosting your knowledge of data science

:::{.fragment .fade-in}
- What these sessions are [not]{.alert} meant for: 
    - Solving the assignments for you
    - Taking care of developing your coding skills
:::

## Class etiquette

:::{style="margin-top: 60px; font-size: 26px;"}
:::

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=70%}
- Coding can be tough and push you out of your comfort zone. If the course pace is too fast, let us know. I expect your commitment, but [I do not want anyone to fail]{.alert}
- You are all keen on data science, but your backgrounds vary. That is great! Some sessions might be more engaging than others. If you are bored, [help others]{.alert} or explore new data science areas
- [Always be respectful]{.alert} to each other
- [Ask questions]{.alert} whenever you need to!

## Software

::: {style="margin-top: 40px;"}
:::

- **Git**: Version control system. Download it [here](https://git-scm.com/). Instructions for installation [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). Feel free to configure it if you wish (instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup)), but we are going to talk about it in class

- **GitHub**: Online platform for hosting code repositories. You will use it a lot, and not only for this class. Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/) and register for a student/educator [discount](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new)

- There is a series of tutorials available on our course website on how to set up Git and GitHub: <https://danilofreire.github.io/datasci350/tutorials/tutorials.html>

## OS extras

::: {style="margin-top: 40px;"}
:::

- **Windows:** Please install [Windows Subsystem for Linux (bash)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). Another good tutorial can be found [here](https://itsfoss.com/install-bash-on-windows/). [FAQ available here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/faq)
- **Mac:** None, but you can install [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/), [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) for a better experience
- **Linux:** None, you should be good to go
  - [Tip]{.alert}: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a great code editor and it [already includes a terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/getting-started)

## Other tools

::: {style="margin-top: 40px;"}
:::

- We will have time to install other tools during the course. But if you want to get ahead, you can install the following:
- **VS Code**: Code editor. Download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- **Anaconda**: Python distribution. Download it [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)
- **Docker**: Containerisation tool. Download it [here](https://www.docker.com/)
- **SQLite**: You can use the [sqlite3](https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/sqlite3.html) Python package or install the [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html) database. The package has everything you need to get started

::: {style="margin-top: 30px;"}
:::

- Tutorials for these tools are available on our course website: <https://danilofreire.github.io/datasci350/tutorials/tutorials.html>

## Next class

:::{style="margin-top: 60px;"}
:::

::: {style="font-size: 28px;"}
- We will cover computational literacy, including binary and hexadecimal numbers, and character encoding systems like ASCII and Unicode
- We will also discuss the early days of computing, focusing on Konrad Zuse's work with digital computers and binary arithmetic
- We will talk about the evolution of programming languages, from assembly to modern high-level languages like Python, and the differences between compiled and interpreted languages
- There will be time for questions about installing the terminal. You do not need it for next week, but consider installing it soon, as it will be necessary in two weeks. Please create a [GitHub educational account](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new) if you do not have one 😉
