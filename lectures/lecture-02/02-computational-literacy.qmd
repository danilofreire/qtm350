The 1970s marked the transition from mechanical to electronic:

:::{.incremental}
- [Transistors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor) act as switches for electronic signals
- [Integrated circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit) combine multiple transistors on a single chip
- [Microprocessors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microprocessor) are integrated circuits that contain the functions of a computer's central processing unit (CPU)
- They follow the [Von Neumann architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture)
:::

## Von Neumann Architecture 

:::{style="margin-top:40px;"}
:::

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](figures/neumann.webp)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
:::{style="font-size: 24px;"}
- The [Von Neumann Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture) stores both program instructions and data together in a slow storage medium, such as a [hard disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive), and transfers them to faster [RAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory) for execution by the [CPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit)
- This is the basis for [almost all modern computers]{.alert}
- When proposed in 1945, this architecture was revolutionary, as [programs were previously seen as part of the machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computing_hardware), distinct from the data they operated on

- Advantages:
  - Efficient memory use, with less need for separate areas
  - Flexibility in data storage and manipulation
  - Simplicity in design and operation

- Disadvantages:
  - [Von Neumann bottleneck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture#Von_Neumann_bottleneck): Limits computing performance due to sequential processing of instructions and data through a single bus
  - The CPU often waits for data due to its faster processing speed compared to memory transfer rates
  - [Harvard architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_architecture) is an alternative that separates data and instruction memory

# Data representation {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Computers run on 0s and 1s

:::{style="margin-top:40px;"}
:::

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
:::{style="font-size: 24px;"}
- Computers represent everything by using [0s and 1s]{.alert}
- Transistors act as [switches]{.alert}, with 1 for high voltage level and 0 for low voltage level
- Computers use binary because transistors are [easy to fabricate]{.alert} in silicon and can be densely packed on a chip

:::{.incremental}
- _But how does this work?_
- How can we represent text, images, and videos using only 0s and 1s?
- This leads us to [abstraction]{.alert}: representing ideas at different
  levels of detail by identifying what is essential
- We will use abstraction to translate 0s and 1s to decimal numbers, then
  translate those numbers to other types

## Number systems – binary

:::{style="margin-top:40px;"}
:::

:::{.incremental}
:::{style="font-size: 24px;"}
- Now let us go back to computers! `r emo::ji('computer')`
- We can represent numbers using only 0s and 1s with the binary number system
- Instead of counting the number of 1s, 5s, 10s, and 25s coins you need, count
  the number of 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, etc
- Why these numbers? They are [powers of 2]{.alert}. This is a number in [base
  2]{.alert}

- A [single binary digit is a bit]{.alert}, e.g., 101 has three bits
- An [8-bit group is called a byte]{.alert}, e.g., 10101010
- Binary numbers grow as follows:
  - 0 represents zero
  - 1 represents one
  - 10 represents two
  - 100 represents four
  - 1000 represents eight, and so on…
:::
:::

## Quick question!

:::{style="margin-top:40px;"}
:::

- [Think-Pair-Share]{.alert}: what is the binary representation of the decimal
  number 3?

[Practice Exercise 01]{.alert}: 

1. What binary number represents 5?

2. What binary number represents 7?

3. What binary number represents 9?

4. What binary number represents 11?

## Convert binary to decimal

:::{style="margin-top:40px;"}
:::

To convert a binary number to decimal, just add each power of 2 that is
represented by a 1.

:::{style="font-size: 26px;"}
- For example, 00011000 = 16 + 8 = 24

| 128 | 64 | 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |
|-----|----|----|----|----|---|---|---|
|  0  | 0  | 0  | 1  | 1  | 0 | 0 | 0 |


<br>

- Another example: 10010001 = 128 + 16 + 1 = 145

| 128 | 64 | 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |
|-----|----|----|----|----|---|---|---|
|  1  | 0  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0 | 0 | 1 |

# Binary and abstraction {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Binary and abstraction

<br>

- Now that we can represent numbers using binary, [we can represent everything
  computers store using binary]{.alert}
- We just need to use [abstraction]{.alert} to interpret bits or numbers in particular ways
- Let us consider colours, images, and text

## Images as collections of colours

:::{style="margin-top:40px;"}
:::

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
![](figures/mona-lisa.png)
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
:::{style="font-size: 28px; margin-top: 40px;"}
:::{.incremental}
- What if we want to represent an image? How can we convert that to numbers?
- First, break the image down into a grid of colours, where each dot of color has a distinct hue 
- A dot of color in this context is called a [pixel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel)
- Now we just need to represent a single color (a pixel) as a number!
:::
:::
:::
::::

## Images as collections of colours
### RGB colour model

:::{style="margin-top:40px;"}
:::

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
![](figures/rgb.png)
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
:::{style="font-size: 24px; margin-top: 40px;"}
:::{.incremental}
- The [RGB colour model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model) is
  widely used in digital displays
- Each pixel is represented by three numbers, each ranging from 0 to 255
- The first number represents the amount of red, the second the amount of
  green, and the third the amount of blue
- 00000000 is no r/g/b and 11111111 is very r/g/b! 
- You can try different colours [here](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_rgb.asp)

## Number systems – Hexadecimal
### What is hexadecimal?

:::{style="margin-top:20px;"}
:::

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](figures/hexadecimal.png)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
:::{style="font-size: 22px; margin-top: 20px;"}
:::{.incremental}
- When we represent values with multiple bytes, it can be hard to distinguish where numbers begin and end
- [Hexadecimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal) is a number system with 16 digits: 0123456789**ABCDEF**
- It is used to represent binary numbers in a more compact way
- Each hex digit corresponds to 4 binary bits, making it a shorthand for binary:
  - 0000 = 0
  - 0001 = 1
  - 0010 = 2
  - ...
  - 1110 = E
  - 1111 = F
:::
:::
:::
::::

## Binary to hex conversion

:::{style="margin-top:40px;"}
:::

- Convert binary to hex by grouping into blocks of four bits.
- Example: Binary `1001 1110 0000 1010` converts to Hex `9E0A`.

<br>

:::{.fragment .fade-in}
[Practice Exercise 02]{.alert}:

1. Convert the decimal number 13 to binary.

2. Convert the decimal number 13 to hexadecimal. 
:::

## Hexadecimal and HTML
### Hex and RGB

:::{style="margin-top:40px;" .incremental}
- HTML uses hexadecimal to represent colours
- Six-digit hex numbers specify colours:
  - FFFFFF = White
  - 000000 = Black

- Each pair of digits represents a colour component (RGB).

- Each color channel typically has a range from 0 to 255 (in 8-bit systems), which gives a total of 256 intensity levels for each primary color.

- When you combine the three channels, you get a possible color palette of $256^3$ or about 16.7 million colours

:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
:::{style="font-size: 24px; margin-top: 40px;"}
:::{.incremental}
- Next, how do we represent text?
- First, we break it down into smaller parts, like with images. In this case,
  we can break text down into [individual characters]{.alert}
- A **character** is the smallest component of text, like A, B, or /.
- A [**glyph**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyph) is the graphical representation of a character.
- In programming, the display of glyphs is typically handled by GUI (Graphical
  User Interface) toolkits or font renderers

:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
:::{style="font-size: 22px; margin-top: 40px;"}
:::{.incremental}
- For example, the text "Hello World" becomes `H, e, l, l, o, space, W, o, r, l, d` 
- Unlike colours, characters do not have a logical connection to numbers
- To represent characters as numbers, we use a [lookup table]{.alert} called
  [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII)
- ASCII stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange
- As long as every computer uses the same lookup table, computers can always translate a set of numbers into the same set of characters
:::

## ASCII is nothing but a simple lookup table
### Yes, really!

:::{style="margin-top:40px;"}
:::

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
For basic characters, we can use the encoding system called ASCII. This maps
the numbers 0 to 255 to characters. Therefore, one character is represented by
one byte

## ASCII Limitations

:::{style="margin-top:40px; font-size: 24px;"}

- ASCII only includes unaccented characters.
- Languages requiring accented characters cannot be represented.
- Even English needs characters like ‘é’ for words such as ‘café’.

:::{style="margin-top:20px;"}
- To address this, [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) was developed
- Unicode is a superset of ASCII that includes characters from all languages, as well as symbols and emojis
- The Unicode system represents every character that can be typed into a
  computer. It uses up to 5 bytes, which can represent up to 1 trillion
  characters! 
- UTF-8 stands for Transformation Format 8-bit

- Find all the Unicode characters here: <https://symbl.cc/en/unicode-table/>
  - "Danilo" in Unicode: `\u0044\u0061\u006e\u0069\u006c\u006f`
  - "QTM 350" in Unicode: `\u0051\u0054\u004d\u0020\u0033\u0035\u0030`

- [Assembly language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language) is a
  low-level programming language that allows writing machine code in human-readable text
- Each instruction corresponds to a single machine code instruction
- The first assemblers were human!
- Programmers wrote assembly code, which secretaries transcribed to binary for machine processing

- The [Apollo 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11) mission to the moon
  was programmed in assembly language
- The code is available here: <https://github.com/chrislgarry/Apollo-11> (good
  luck reading it! `r emo::ji('grinning_face_with_sweat')`)

- One of the files is the `BURN_BABY_BURN--MASTER_IGNITION_ROUTINE.agc` `r emo::ji('fire')` `r emo::ji('rocket')`

- But if Assembly is so fast and efficient, why don't we use it all the time?

## Low-level vs high-level languages

:::{style="margin-top:40px;"}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
:::{style="font-size: 24px;"}
- [Low-level
  languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-level_programming_language) are
  closer to machine code and are harder to read and write
- [High-level languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language)
  abstract from hardware details and are portable across different systems

- **Compiled Languages:** Convert code to binary instructions before execution (e.g., `C++`, `Fortran`, `Go`).
- **Interpreted Languages:** Run inside a program that interprets and executes commands immediately (e.g., `R`, `Python`).

## Solution - Practice Exercise 02 {#sec-solution02}

:::{style="font-size: 22px; margin-top: 40px;"}

1. Decimal 13 is `1101` in binary.
  - Break it down: $13 = (1 \times 2^3) + (1 \times 2^2) + (0 \times 2^1) + (1 \times 2^0)$.

2. Binary 1101 is `D` in hexadecimal.
  - Group the binary into blocks of four: `1101`.
  - Convert each block to hex: `1101` (binary) = `D` (hex).
  - Let's take a closer look at how to convert the binary number `1101` to hexadecimal:
  - Start with the binary number: `1101`
  - Convert it to decimal by summing the powers of 2:
    - $1 \times 2^3$ = 8
    - $1 \times 2^2$ = 4
    - $0 \times 2^1$ = 0
    - $1 \times 2^0$ = 1
    
- Add the decimal values: $8 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 13$
- The decimal number `13` corresponds to the hexadecimal number `D`.
- Therefore, binary `1101` is `D` in hexadecimal.

## Solution - Practice Exercise 03 {#sec-solution03}

:::{style="font-size: 24px; margin-top: 40px;"}
- Step 1: Identify the binary strings: `01011001 01100001 01111001`

- Step 2: Convert each binary string to its decimal equivalent
  - 01011001 = 89
  - 01100001 = 97
  - 01111001 = 121

- Step 3: Map each decimal value to its corresponding ASCII character
  - 89 = Y
  - 97 = a
  - 121 = y

- Step 4: Combine the ASCII characters to form the final text
  - Result: Yay
