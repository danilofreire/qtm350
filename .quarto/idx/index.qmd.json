This course introduces key tools in modern data science, focusing on three essential aspects: reliability, reproducibility, and robustness. We will cover the [command-line interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface), version control with [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/), and literate programming using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). You will also learn about [cloud computing with AWS (basics)](https://aws.amazon.com/), data storage and manipulation with [SQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/) and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and parallel computing with [Dask](https://www.dask.org/).
