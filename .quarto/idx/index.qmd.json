This course introduces key tools in modern data science, focusing on three essential aspects: reliability, reproducibility, and robustness. We will cover the [command-line interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface), version control with [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/), and literate programming using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). You will also learn about [cloud computing with AWS (basics)](https://aws.amazon.com/), data storage and manipulation with [SQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/) and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and parallel computing with [Dask](https://www.dask.org/). We will explore AI-assisted programming with [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) and [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) and finish with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and containerisation. \n\nWe will meet every Monday and Wednesday from 4pm to 5:15pm in the [Psychology Building, Room 230](http://emap.fmd.emory.edu/website/campus/index.htm#?queryzoom=Yes&Query=(bldg='2045')).\n\n\n### Instructor\n\n- **Name**: [Danilo Freire](https://danilofreire.github.io/)\n- **Email**: [`danilo.freire@emory.edu`](mailto:danilo.freire@emory.edu)\n- **Office Hours**: By appointment at your convenience, please email me to schedule a meeting\n\n### Teaching Assistants\n\n- **Name**: Alix Morales\n- **Email**: [`alix.morales@emory.edu`](mailto:alix.morales@emory.edu) \n\n- **Name**: Harris Wang\n- **Email**: [`harris.wang@emory.edu`](mailto:harris.wang@emory.edu)\n\n- Please email them if you would like to schedule a meeting\n\n## Learning Outcomes\n\nBy the end of this course, students will be able to:\n\n- Use the command line interface to manage files and directories.\n- Work with version control systems to track changes in code and collaborate with others.\n- Create reproducible reports and presentations.\n- Use AI tools to assist with programming tasks.\n- Apply advanced techniques for data storage, manipulation, and querying.\n- Understand the basics of containerisation and parallel computing.\n\n## Website Structure\n\nThis website contains the [course syllabus](https://danilofreire.github.io/qtm350/syllabus.html), [lecture materials](https://danilofreire.github.io/qtm350/lectures/lectures.html), [tutorials](https://danilofreire.github.io/qtm350/tutorials/tutorials.html), and\n[assignments](https://danilofreire.github.io/qtm350/assignments/assignments.html) for the course.
