title: "DATASCI 350 - Data Science Computing"
---

Welcome to [DATASCI 350](https://github.com/danilofreire/datasci350)! This course introduces key tools in modern data science, focusing on three essential aspects: reliability, reproducibility, and robustness. We will cover the [command-line interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface), version control with [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/), and literate programming using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). You will also learn about [cloud computing with AWS (basics)](https://aws.amazon.com/), data storage and manipulation with [SQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/) and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and parallel computing with [Dask](https://www.dask.org/). We will explore AI-assisted programming with [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) and [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) and finish with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and containerisation. 

We will meet every Monday and Wednesday from 5:30pm to 6:45pm in the [Psychology Building, Room 230](http://emap.fmd.emory.edu/website/campus/index.htm#?queryzoom=Yes&Query=(bldg='2045')).
