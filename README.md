# QTM 350 - Data Science Computing

## Course Description

Welcome to [QTM 350](https://github.com/danilofreire/qtm350)! This course introduces key tools in modern data science, focusing on three essential aspects: reliability, reproducibility, and robustness. We will cover command line interfaces and [vim](https://www.vim.org/), version control with [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/), and literate programming using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). You will also learn about data storage and manipulation with [SQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/) and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), data visualisation using [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) and [plotnine](https://plotnine.readthedocs.io/), and parallel computing with [Dask](https://www.dask.org/). We will explore artificial intelligence-assisted programming with [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) and finish with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and containerisation. Throughout the course, you will learn how to use these tools to improve your data science workflow and create more reliable, reproducible, and robust analyses.
