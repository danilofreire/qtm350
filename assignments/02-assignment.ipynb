    "## Assignment 02: Using the Command Line Interface\n",
    "### Due 17 September 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will practice using various command line interface (CLI) commands covered in the lecture. You will complete a series of tasks and submit your work either as a Jupyter Notebook or a PDF document with screenshots.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open your terminal or command prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Navigate to a directory where you want to create a new folder for this assignment using the `cd` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create a new directory called \"cli_assignment\" using the `mkdir` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Change into the \"cli_assignment\" directory using the `cd` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Complete the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "   a. Use the `ls` command to list the contents of the current directory. Take a screenshot of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "   b. Create a new file called \"README.md\" using the `touch` command. Use the `ls` command again to verify that the file was created. Take a screenshot of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "   c. Use the `echo` command to append the text \"# CLI Assignment\" to the \"README.md\" file. Use the `cat` command to display the contents of the file. Take a screenshot of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "   d. Create a new directory called \"data\" inside the \"cli_assignment\" directory using the `mkdir` command. Use the `ls` command with the `-l` flag to display the contents of the \"cli_assignment\" directory in long format. Take a screenshot of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "   e. Use the `man` command to display the manual page for the `ls` command. Scroll through the manual page and find the flag that allows you to display hidden files. Use the `ls` command with this flag to display all files, including hidden files, in the current directory. Take a screenshot of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using Jupyter Notebooks:\n",
    "- Create a new Jupyter Notebook in the \"cli_assignment\" directory.\n",
    "- For each task, create a new code cell and execute the required commands.\n",
    "- After each task, create a new markdown cell and include the screenshot of the output.\n",
    "- Save the Jupyter Notebook and submit it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using a PDF document:\n",
    "- Open a new document in your preferred word processor.\n",
    "- For each task, include the command(s) you used and the corresponding screenshot of the output.\n",
    "- Save the document as a PDF and submit it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment will help you become more comfortable with navigating the file system, creating and manipulating files and directories, and using the `man` command to explore command options. Good luck!"

    "There are several ways to run command line commands in Jupyter. You can use the following approaches:\n",

    "1. Using the `!` prefix:\n",

    "   - For example, to list the files in the current directory, you can use: `!ls`\n",
