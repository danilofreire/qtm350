Here you will find information about the assignments for [DATASCI 350](https://github.com/danilofreire/datasci350). There are ten of them, each worth 5% of your final grade. The assignments are designed to help you practice the concepts covered in class and to develop your data science skills.

Assignment submissions are typically due on Wednesdays at 11:59pm in the week following their publication. You may submit via Canvas (preferred) or email (<danilo.freire@emory.edu>).

We encourage you to complete assignments in Jupyter Notebooks and submit them in PDF format. You can also submit them as a Word document, provided that code and results are included in the same document.

You will find the assignments in `.ipynb` format in the `assignments` folder on [the course repository](https://github.com/danilofreire/datasci350/tree/main/assignments). For your convenience, rendered versions are available on the course website; links are provided below.

When submitting, please name your files as follows: `assignment-01-your-name.pdf`. For instance: `assignment-01-john-doe.pdf`.
