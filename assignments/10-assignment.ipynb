    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is about parallel computing with Dask. You should use Python to implement the calculations. If possible, please submit your answers in PDF  or HTML format. In case you have any issues installing Dask via pip, please use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m pip install \"dask[complete]\" --use-deprecated=legacy-resolver\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command will resolve dependencies and install the required packages for Dask.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also install Dask using conda (which the authors recommend):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda install dask\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you encounter any issues, please check their website: <https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/install.html> and let us know."

    "```python\n",
    "inputs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, use the function `time.time()` to measure the time it takes to run the function `intensive_task` for each value in the list `inputs` using a regular `for` loop. Store the results in a list called `results`. Remember to create the `start_time` and `end_time` variables to measure the time taken for the computation. The result, which is the difference between `end_time` and `start_time`, should be printed.\n",
